AD,3014,ADS,Soundscape,"Andrews, Nancy","Soundscape may be defined as an environment of sound (or sonic environment) with emphasis on the way it is perceived and understood by the individual, or by a society. It thus depends upon the relationship between the individual and any such environment. The term may refer to actual environments, or to abstract constructions such as musical compositions and tape montages, particularly when considered as an artificial environment. In this interdisciplinary course we investigate a broad range of acoustic concepts, ranging from a scientific treatment of the nature and behavior of sound both in air and underwater, the biology of hearing, the use of sound by animals in communication, and the cultural applications of sound and music in human society. Students will explore methods of composition using sounds as materials for assigned projects. Various approaches to understanding and experiencing sound will be examined, including spoken word, radio shows, music, and experimental forms. Labs will focus on understanding the nature of sound, and practical application of sound equipment, technique and theory. Students will learn about microphones, sound recording, amplification, and the physics of sound. The course will culminate in a performance to the community of student presentations that expresses the wide use of sound as part of our culture. Evaluation will be based on class participation and a set of assignments, including a final project. Emphasis will be placed on an artistic interpretation of soundscape, although students will be expected to have a basic understanding of the scientific basis of acoustic phenomena.

AD,4013,ADS,Installation Art: Activating Spaces,"Colbert, Dru","""space in active dialogue with the things and people it contains...""  -RoseLee Golberg, from Space as Praxis
Installation art is one of the most original, vigorous, and fertile forms of contemporary art. 

It often involves working in specific non-art sites where the activation of the place, or context, of artistic intervention is concerned not only with art and its boundaries, but also with the fusion of art and life. Installation art extends the area of practice from the studio to public space. Architects, urban planners, and environmental designers consider similar formal and social aspects of space in the creation of city plans, buildings, and public spaces. Through hands-on projects and a survey of historic and contemporary art and design work, this intermediate level 3D studio course offers an opportunity to explore formal aspects and social contexts of space and time as a medium for making art.

Students will create interior and exterior installations that may incorporate sculptural elements, everyday objects, light, sound, or other devices. Course work will investigate the objective and subjective qualities of space, material, and form, and the meanings created through their juxtaposition. In addition to studio work, we will survey a variety of historic and contemporary contextual art works including: spaces laid out by architects and designers, installation itself as an art form, public art projects, sacred spaces, the work of visionary artists, historic sites, and monuments.  Students will be evaluated on their participation in class activities and critiques, their timely completion of projects, and attendance.

ED,1013,HS ED,"Changing Schools, Changing Society","Tai, Bonnie","How have schools changed and how should schools change to ensure ""the good life""?  This interdisciplinary, team-taught course examines the potential and limits of a human ecological education as an instrument of enlightened progress and lasting positive social, cultural, and environmental change.  It explores three essential questions about education and its relationship to human development and social progress.  Looking at the role of formal educational institutions and their relationship to government and other social institutions: What is the role of schools in development and social change?  Considering the role of teachers as agents of change: What is the role of the teacher in school/organizational change and community development?  And finally, reflecting on our subjective motives for working in the field of education:  Why do you want to become an educator?   Through course activities such as service-learning in schools and group project work on a contemporary educational phenomenon (e.g., school choice, new technologies for learning, single-sex education), students will learn how educational policy at the federal, state, and local levels impacts teaching and learning, investigate the moral dimensions of the teacher-student relationship, and reflect on the construct of teacher-learners.  Students will be introduced to a variety of educational research methods (i.e, ethnography, case study, quasi-experimental, correlational) that will allow for critical analysis of the knowledge base that strives to impact educational policy and practice. Evaluation will be based on participation, reflective writing, service learning, and group projects and presentations.

ED,1014,ED,Child Development,"Alex, Joanne","How does a child think? What causes him/her to learn? What teaching approaches work best with young children? These questions and more will be explored through readings, lectures, field observations, and planned class activities. This course will provide an introduction to early childhood education (preschool to eighth grade). Theorists such as Piaget, Vygotsky, Montessori, Gardner, Erikson, Maslow, Kohlberg, and Gilligan will be used to examine the physical, mental, emotional, moral, and social aspects of childhood growth and development.

ES,3034,ES,Ecology and Biology of Fungi,"Porter, David","Fungi (the mushrooms, molds and mildews) are numerous, diverse, and integral to the normal functioning of our ecosystem.  Fungi are so different from other organisms in their structure and function that, since the middle of the 20th century, science has recognized a separate kingdom for the Fungi.  This robust evolutionary branch of the tree of life is populated with more than 100,000 species.  Fungi carry out their essential activities of decomposition, recycling and interaction with other organisms in virtually every ecosystem on Earth.  

This class will introduce students to mycology (the study of fungi) with discussions, demonstrations, field trips and hands-on laboratory investigations of these fascinating organisms.  We will provide the basics of mycology through lecture, discussion and text, but the students in this class will derive a lasting understanding of what fungi are and what they do through active learning exercises in the field and in the laboratory.  Evaluation will be based on class participation, field and laboratory observations, project presentation oral and written, exams - midterm, final, and lab.

As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions.  This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets. Most of the evaluation is based on critique of student independent final project work and related documentation.

Why does Coca Cola spend millions of dollars to advertise a product with which most people are already very familiar? What can the game of blackjack tell us about how industries are structured? How can we get coal-burning power utilities to reduce their carbon emissions while they save millions of dollars in the process? How can we provide much better health care to all Americans, at much less cost, while making it easier for small businesses to grow? All of these questions, and many more like them, are answered by microeconomic theory. This intermediate-level course exposes students to basic microeconomic theories, models, and concepts that shed insight on the economic behavior of businesses, individuals, governments and politicians, and international organizations. We will emphasize approaches that have numerous overlapping applications to both business and policy evaluation: markets, pricing, firm structure and decision-making, strategic behavior (using game theory), consumer behavior, externalities (such as greenhouse gas emissions) and the provision of public goods (such as military, education, and environmental conservation). We will pay special attention to the economics of asymmetrical information (adverse selection, moral hazard, and principal-agent situations) that have a wide range of applications, including issues such as the ineffectiveness of the American health care system, the structuring of business finance, and the hiring and paying of employees. This will be a non-calculus course, but will give students exposure to technical economic modeling, with heavy emphasis on graphical modeling of complex social phenomena.  We will use a lab period to conduct extensive experiments and games that illustrate or test economic concepts and hypotheses.

Being able to speak the language of business is critical for activists, social entrepreneurs and business owners alike. Financial statements are a key component of this language. These statements measure the fiscal health of both non-profit and for-profit organizations. They provide insight into all areas of the company.  They are a powerful tool for determining investments, competitive positioning and have extraordinary impacts on all of an organization's stakeholders. Unfortunately, most people, including many who run a wide variety of organizations, fail to grasp this language. In doing so, they undermine their organization's opportunity for success, as well as create obstacles to using business as a means of social change. Without guidance, looking at these financial statements is similar to examining hieroglyphics for the first time. Starting from a basic level and layering in complexity, the course will seek to demystify these statements in a way that is informative and unintimidating. In addition, time will be spent advancing students' understanding and familiarity with spreadsheets.

Topics of the course will include:  Creating and analyzing cash flow statements, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, as well as common sized income statements; Differentiating between each type of financial statement; Relating these statements to each other, tying them together and varying statements depending on business models; Comparing non-profit and for-profit financial statements and approaches; Examining key financial ratios and how they are different for different businesses; and Spreadsheet management and design.

Researchers such as Joseph Grinnell, Starker Leopold, Ned Johnson, Phillip Munz and Jim Patton contributed enormously to our understanding of the interactions, distribution and abundance of the enormous range of plants and animals occupying the western states, while the incredible variety of topography found between the Pacific slope and Great Basin Desert, containing both the highest and lowest points in the Lower 48, has provided an ideal setting for both observation and experimentation. This intensive field-based course will provide students with the opportunity to examine first-hand some key habitats within Nevada, California, and New Mexico, and to conduct a series of short projects on the fauna and flora in select sites. Areas to be examined will include terminal saline lakes, open deserts , montane meadows, pine forest, riparian hardwoods, wetlands, and agricultural landscapes. Readings will include primary sources and more popular accounts of both locations and the peoples who have lived in these lands over the past several thousand years.

HS,4043,HS,Wilderness in the West: Promise and Problems,"Cline, Ken","Wilderness has been the clarion call for generations of environmentalists. In a letter in support of the Wilderness Act, writer Wallace Stegner characterized the importance of wilderness as an essential ""part of the geography of hope."" That single phrase and the current controversy surrounding the concept of wilderness provide the central focus of our explorations of wilderness in western lands. This course examines the question of wilderness from multiple perspectives in the hopes of providing an understanding of both the concept and real spaces that constitute wilderness. Through conversations with wilderness managers, field work, and experience in federally designated wilderness areas in National Parks, National Forests, Wildlife Refuges and on BLM lands, the course will also examine what ""wilderness management"" means on the ground in the varied landscapes of the western United States. In this context, we look at historical and contemporary acco unts of the value of wilderness, ecological and cultural arguments for wilderness, and the legal and policy difficulties of ""protecting"" wilderness. Considerable time is spent evaluating current criticisms of the wilderness idea and practice. The class will culminate at a week-long national conference celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Wilderness Act. The 50th Anniversary National Wilderness Conference provides an incomparable opportunity for students to hear from and interact with federal management agencies, academics, recreation experts, and environmental advocacy organizations. Presenting their final course work at this conference will also give students an opportunity to share their ideas and to receive valuable feedback from this sophisticated and well-informed audience of wilderness experts. Classwork emphasizes hands-on service-learning projects as well as reading, writing, and theoretical discussions. Students will be evaluated on journal entrie s, contributions to the class discussions, response rapers, engagement in field activities, questions in the field, and contributions to group work.  This course will be integrated with and requires co-enrollment in Reading the West and Ecology and Natural History of the West.

AD,2025,NA,Principles of Comedic Improvisation,"Fingerhut, Larrance","This course teaches the underlying principles of improvisational comedy.  Improv at its most basic level is about agreement, cooperation, and collaboration towards a common goal.  Improvisers must offer their support/agreement in a very real and active way by listening to their fellow performers and by offering their own ideas/initiations/creativity.  In this way people work together to build a scene/story out of nothing but pure creativity and the willingness to support and agree with one another.  The most fundamental idea of improvisational comedy is captured in the phrase ""Yes, and....""  Every improviser is responsible for saying ""Yes..."" to every idea he or she receives and to add her or his own input and ideas.  Students will be taught the basic principles of improvisation and will get a chance to improvise in each class.

AD,2025,NA,Principles of Comedic Improvisation,"Fingerhut, Larrance","This course teaches the underlying principles of improvisational comedy.  Improv at its most basic level is about agreement, cooperation, and collaboration towards a common goal.  Improvisers must offer their support/agreement in a very real and active way by listening to their fellow performers and by offering their own ideas/initiations/creativity.  In this way people work together to build a scene/story out of nothing but pure creativity and the willingness to support and agree with one another.  The most fundamental idea of improvisational comedy is captured in the phrase ""Yes, and....""  Every improviser is responsible for saying ""Yes..."" to every idea he or she receives and to add her or his own input and ideas.  Students will be taught the basic principles of improvisation and will get a chance to improvise in each class.  Classes will consist of ensemble building warm-ups, theatrical improvisational games, and improv scene work that will encourage each participant to offer their ideas without judgment.

HS,2050,NA,Religious Intolerance in the United States,"Wessler, Stephen L","This course will examine bias directed at religions in the contemporary United States.  In this course we will examine our own religious identities as well as the stereotypes we have about religions.  We will also probe the level and impact of bias toward a number of religions in the US, including Jehovah’s Witnesses, members of the Church of the Latter Day Saints, Catholics, members of new religious movements, Jews and Muslims.  This course will address timely and controversial issues including the relationship between religion and laws and policies affecting the LGBTQ population, immigration and terrorism.  Finally, conflict resolution efforts both in Kosovo, aimed at resolving tensions and violence between Albanian Muslims and Serbian Orthodox Christians, and in Northern Ireland, addressing animosity and violence between Catholics and Protestants, will prompt a discussion of approaches for reducing anti-religious bias.  Students will be evaluated on 3 papers (a paper on each student's religious or non-religious identity, a research paper on a topic chosen by each student and an opinion editorial), class discussion and short written assignments relating to the readings for the course.

AD,2020,AD HY,History of Photography,"Winer, Joshua","This introductory course charts the history of photography from early nineteenth-century nascent technologies (daguerreotypes and tintypes) through to the diverse range of photographic media currently practiced by contemporary artists and photographers (film and digital).  In this art history course, we will consider how the new visual discourse of photography was informed by both technological and social developments.  Photography cannot be defined as a unified medium; therefore, this course investigates both discontinuous as well as coalesced conventions within its own history; in other words, how and why photographs look different from each other.  In addition to noting external influences upon the photographic object, we will explore how photography helped to shape a variety of visual disciplines from painting to zines.  Accordingly, our class will discuss formal photographic syntax (how they are composed and the forms they appear represent) and allied aesthetic practices as well as the wider social and political issues that influenced the content of its visual culture.  We will study how artists use photographic practices in the context of social and activist functions to examine a diversity of subjects: gender and class, ethnic and national identity, among others; and, how categorical distinctions between mass culture and avant-garde art, commercial and fine art photography are not always stable.  Course readings include writings by historians, artists, and critics that reflect the unstable status of the photographic object within the intersections of science, technology and culture, aesthetic discourse and everyday documentation.  We will look at many photographs.  Students will be evaluated on their participation in class discussions, short essay assignments, and a final project or paper.

ES,3022,ES QR,Differential Equations,"Feldman, David","Differential equations are an application of calculus used to model a  wide variety of physical and natural phenomena.  The rate at which a cup of coffee cools, populations of predators and prey in ecosystems, the spread of disease, and the behavior of electric circuits, are all examples of systems that have been described with differential  equations.  This course is an introduction to ordinary differential equations, intended for students who have completed a single-variable calculus course.  The course covers a variety of techniques for solving and understanding differential equations, including numerical  and qualitative solution methods.  Students will learn to solve and analyze differential equations using the python programming language. Students will also gain experience formulating mathematical models using differential equations.  To do so, we will discuss general  modeling principles and also consider several case studies.  In addition to learning the mathematics of differential equations, a central goal of this course is to gain skills necessary for research in the mathematical, natural, and social sciences.  This includes  conceptualizing and framing a research question, conducing a literature review, giving a research presentation, and writing up results in a style appropriate for publication.  

Evaluation will be based on class participation, bi-weekly problem  sets, and a term-long project culminating in a presentation and short research paper.  Some computer work will be required, but no computer experience is necessary.

HS,1042,HS,Globalization/Anti-Globalization,"van Vliet, Netta","The terms globalization and anti-globalization are often used to refer to increasing cultural homogeneity across the globe, but also to growing familiarity with multiple forms of diversity and intercultural exchange. These terms also reference notions of progress and development, but also increasing poverty and inequality. In this course, we will look at how historical perspectives of the forces of globalization -- including capitalism, European modernity and its colonial histories -- shape contemporary understandings of and debates over immigration, labor, gender and ethnic difference, national boundaries and their transgression, the law, justice and human rights. We will think critically about concepts such as agency, freedom, and even the notion of the human itself. Relatedly, this course will challenge you to think about the implications of how difference – national, gender, ethnic, and otherwise - is understood in terms of globalization for political problems such as war, poverty, environmental destruction, sexual violence, imperialism, and freedom of movement and expression. Over the course of the term, we will examine how human relations in specific locales are shaped through economic and cultural exchanges, mass media, different forms of representation and changing means of mobility. To this end, we will draw on specific examples from African, European, Middle Eastern and Latin American contexts. This is an interdisciplinary course that draws on the fields of anthropology, literature, feminist theory, and postcolonial studies. In addition to academic texts, we will be reading from novels, engaging with film, and listening to music. Evaluation of students will be based on the following: informal reading responses, one mid-term paper and one final paper, and class participation.

The instructor will provide useful activities, information, resources, critiques and guidance.  A schedule of presentations of student works-in-progress will be created. Readings will address ideas and theories related to animation studies and processes.  Advanced animation techniques may include camera work and sound design. Work completed over the term may be a single longer animation or a series of animated shorts depending on the student’s preference and animation goals.  However, all students will be expected to produce advanced level work and encouraged to experiment and push their work to the highest level.   Students will be evaluated on their projects, participation in critiques and discussions and overall level of engagement with the course material and class.

HS,3034,HS,Conspiracy Theory and Political Discourse,"McKown, Jamie","The fear of the ""hidden"" enemy that lurks behind the shadows is a narrative theme that appears periodically in the political discourse of all democratic societies. Yet, this narrative of fear (often labeled as conspiracy theory) is regularly criticized as somehow being inherently antidemocratic, irrational, or dangerous. At the same time, this form of argument can also be ""mainstreamed"" and defended as a legitimate response to the events of the moment. How do we make sense of this tension? If conspiracy theory as a mode of explanation is inherently ""irrational,"" what does this mean for its enduring presence in our political discourse?  Is the only difference between a reasonable claim rooted in fear and the conspiracy theories of ""kooks"" and ""nutjobs"" simply a matter of which one is ""correct?""   This class will address the role fear and anxiety plays in our social and political lives. We will explore a variety of topics related directly to how threats, conspiracies, agents of ""evil,"" and ""otherness"" become manifest in public discourse. Specific topics include:  the possible tension between ""rational"" deliberative decision making and the cultivating of anxiety in public governance; why we dismiss some claims as mere conspiracy theory and yet have no problem accepting other similarly formed arguments; what role the ""outsider"" plays in cementing cohesion within an ""in"" group; and the disturbing possibility that fear is actually a healthy component of democratic debate. The class will look at both contemporary and historical examples from the United States and around the world. There are three primary goals of the class: first, to expose students to the analysis of primary texts rooted in public fear and anxiety; second, to provoke discussion about the role of conspiracy and threats in democracies; and third, to provide students with a survey of secondary work that seeks to situate and make sense of these topics. Readings will be a combination of primary artifacts for interpretation (such a speeches, manifestos, pamphlets, and movies) as well as secondary analytical readings.  In addition to the regular class meeting time, students will be expected to attend a weekly evening lab session devoted to the screening of visual works and/or presentations by speakers.  Evaluation will be based on readings driven discussion as well as individual student writing assignments. Students will produce several short length essay assignments during the term as well as a longer research paper at the end of the term.

AD,2011,ADS,Graphic Design Studio I:  Visual Communication,"Colbert, Dru","Visual communication is one of the most pervasive means of human communication. Graphic design, within the realm of visual communication, is a process used to effectively convey ideas and information visually through print, electronic media, products in the marketplace, and structural elements in the built environment. Its application may be promotional, editorial, informational, expositional or instigational.  It may cater to, or critique -- commercialism, colonialism, capitalism, and advertising -- or alternately be used to organize information and visualize complex data, or concepts. Is it possible to construct a visual message that will be received through the din and noise of our overstuffed media environment?  Past other competing messages?  What are some of the contemporary issues surrounding design and the roles and responsibilities of graphic designers in the workplace and in their communities? 

In this introductory/intermediate level studio course you will become familiar with visual rhetoric and the basic elements, principles, and processes of graphic design that will help you to construct effective visual messages.  You will work on a variety of conceptual visual communication projects in the realms of information design, editorial design, and promotional design.  Lectures, demonstrations, assignments and critiques will offer a balanced framework for developing skills in creative perception, critical thinking and visual communication.  An emphasis is placed on these elements and evaluation will be weighted more heavily in these areas than technical expertise on the computer.  You will however, be required to learn the basics of several computer graphic applications (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe InDesign and/or Quark) in order to complete coursework.  You will receive basic instruction in these programs in class, but will be expected to refer to computer manuals and guide books for specific tools and techniques that may be required to visualize your ideas.

AD,2011,ADS,Graphic Design Studio I:  Visual Communication,"Colbert, Dru","Visual communication is one of the most pervasive means of human communication. Graphic design, within the realm of visual communication, is a process used to effectively convey ideas and information visually through print, electronic media, products in the marketplace, and structural elements in the built environment. Its application may be promotional, editorial, informational, expositional or instigational.  It may cater to, or critique -- commercialism, colonialism, capitalism, and advertising -- or alternately be used to organize information and visualize complex data, or concepts. Is it possible to construct a visual message that will be received through the din and noise of our overstuffed media environment?  Past other competing messages?  What are some of the contemporary issues surrounding design and the roles and responsibilities of graphic designers in the workplace and in their communities? 

In this introductory/intermediate level studio course you will become familiar with visual rhetoric and the basic elements, principles, and processes of graphic design that will help you to construct effective visual messages.  You will work on a variety of conceptual visual communication projects in the realms of information design, editorial design, and promotional design.  Lectures, demonstrations, assignments and critiques will offer a balanced framework for developing skills in creative perception, critical thinking and visual communication.  An emphasis is placed on these elements and evaluation will be weighted more heavily in these areas than technical expertise on the computer.  You will however, be required to learn the basics of several computer graphic applications (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe InDesign and/or Quark) in order to complete coursework.  You will receive basic instruction in these programs in class, but will be expected to refer to computer manuals and guide books for specific tools and techniques that may be required to visualize your ideas.

How is meaning shaped by the images we create? In all cultures, throughout time, artists have sought ways to tell stories about far ranging topics -- the unknown, the success of a hunt, gods and goddesses, historical events, wars, court tales, biblical themes, social instruction, morals, politics, product promotion, and personal imaginings.  Historically, artists have adapted visual story telling techniques to exploit evolving technology and changing social concerns, from ancient wall markings, tomb inscriptions, scrolls, illuminated manuscripts, pottery decoration, carved totems, pictorial painting, to sequential engraved prints, comic books, graphic novels, graffiti and the web. In this studio course, students will investigate ""visual language"", symbolism, and some of the pictorial devices, materials, and techniques employed by artists to tell stories visually -particularly through sequential composition in the graphic arts. 

Through focused assignments, discussion of artists' works (historic and across cultures), and guided demonstrations in a variety of materials and techniques, students will respond to select historic forms of visual narrative to create unique contemporary forms in which to tell their own relevant stories. ""Case Study"" studio projects will be selected to focus on key points in world history that mark technological transition in material, technique and pictorial devices employed by artists to render visual narratives.  Projects will range from the hands-on exploration of ancient wall painting and low relief carving technique, through non-press printing techniques such as linocut, image transfer, and potato prints, to collage of found images, xerography, Polaroid print manipulation, digital prints and ""synthetic"" imaging on the computer. Students will be encouraged to explore and invent new forms of sequential composition and utilize new or previously unexplored materials or techniques.  Concurrent investigations in visual studies will focus on the meaning created through the use of pictorial devices, signs and symbols, and the creation of narrative structure through repeated image/duplication, sequential composition, and visual allegory. Students will be evaluated on writing assignments, level of completion and analysis of assigned readings, research and presentation, quality and completion of projects, and participation in class activities and discussion.

The goals of the course are: to introduce students to important physical ideas both conceptually and mathematically; and to help students improve their quantitative skills. The first part of the course consists of a broad look at the three conservation laws: the conservation of momentum, energy, and angular momentum.  Along the way, we'll learn about vectors, work, potential energy, thermal energy, and the energy stored in chemical bonds. We'll conclude with a treatment of Newton's laws of motion.  If time permits, we may briefly cover some topics from chaotic dynamics.  Evaluations will be based on participation in class and lab, weekly homework, and two untimed, open-notes exams. This course makes extensive use of algebra and trigonometry. Potentially difficult math topics will be reviewed as necessary.

Along the way, we'll learn about vectors, work, potential energy, thermal energy, and the energy stored in chemical bonds. We'll conclude with a treatment of Newton's laws of motion.  If time permits, we may briefly cover some topics from chaotic dynamics.  Evaluations will be based on participation in class and lab, weekly homework, and two untimed, open-notes exams. This course makes extensive use of algebra and trigonometry. Potentially difficult math topics will be reviewed as necessary. Prerequisites: Understanding Functions, a strong high school algebra background, or consent of the instructor.

Film was supposed to be dead, once and for all. But film wasn't quite ready to die, and even as the economy and common practice has shifted largely to digital capture, film and photographic paper are still being produced and consumed, albeit on a different scale. This course is an introduction to traditional analog darkroom processes and manual camera operation. Students will gain a basic understanding of black and white photography through exercises and assignments that emphasize fundamental camera and darkroom skills including: proper metering, evaluating quality of light, elements of composition, good negative making and evaluation and good print making and evaluation. Work will be critiqued and evaluated based on both technical and aesthetic merit in a class critique format. Readings will be assigned in conjunction with course content.

HS,2060,HS,Philosophies of Liberation,"Cox, Gray","What is freedom, why might it be of value, how might it be obtained, and what consequences might liberation have for individuals, classes, genders, ethnic groups, races, nationalities or species? In a wide variety of political, social, religious and cultural movements, the notion of freedom as achieved by some kind of liberation is a central theme - and an essentially contested concept which means quite different things to different people. This course focuses on the philosophical tasks of sorting out those different meanings and critically analyzing the frameworks of ideas people use to make sense of their notions of freedom and projects of liberation. It will adopt an intellectual history approach that will include placing the texts in their social and historical as well as philosophical contexts. Readings will include works from Gandhi, Paulo Freire, and writers from the open source and creative commons movements as well as selections from feminist, Buddhist, neo-liberal, Marxist, existentialist, and other traditions. Goals of the course are: 1.) to develop students' philosophical skills in the interpretation of texts in their historical context and the critical analysis of frameworks of ideas, 2.) to develop their critical understanding of alternative visions of freedom and liberation, and 3.) to develop their abilities to communicate sophisticated philosophical analysis in written and oral forms. Evaluations will be based on the demonstration of progress on these goals in class discussion, homework, short and medium sized papers and problem sets.

HS,1046,HS QR,Introduction to Economics & the Economy,"Taylor, Davis","This course provides students with an introduction to both economic theory and the historical and institutional background needed to understand the context, functioning, and trajectory of 21st Century economies. On the theoretical side, students will be introduced to explanations of the economic behavior of individuals and firms (microeconomics) and the workings of national economies and money (macroeconomics), including economic development and international topics such as trade and exchange rates. In addition to the standard neoclassical approaches to these topics, we will also introduce behavioral, feminist, Marxist, and ecological economics perspectives. Complementing these theoretical approaches will be a rich immersion in historical and institutional themes such as the history of capitalism, the rise of corporations, the institutional background of markets for stocks, bonds, and derivatives, inequality and poverty, state-led capitalism (e.g. as seen in China and Brazil) and the events that led up to recent financial crises in the United States and Europe.

HS,1045,HS,Politics of Israel,"van Vliet, Netta","This course focuses on the concept of Israel as a Jewish state and as a liberal democracy. This means that we will both be examining what is singular about Israel, and addressing concepts of the nation-state and liberal democracy more broadly. How can thinking about Israel help us think about the relationship between the nation-state and the concept and treatment of difference? Asking this question through the example of Israel will put other terms into question, including citizen, origin, genocide, value, rights, equality, individual, sovereignty and subjectivity. As we examine these concepts, we will address gender, ethnic, national, economic and linguistic difference in the contexts of Zionism, Israel, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Thus, while the course does not focus explicitly on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, by the end of the semester students should have gained critical thinking skills with which to analyze it should they be so inclined. 

The goal of this course is not to convince students to be more or less sympathetic to any of the myriad political positions that exist with regard to Israel/Palestine. Rather, the aim of this course is to provide conceptual tools with which students can think critically about the concepts through which Israel/Palestine is not only represented but also through which the place and the people who live there come into being in all of their materiality and affect. In particular, we will pay attention to questions of origin, representation, and how the relation between individual and group is understood. Hopefully, such critical thinking skills will serve students well not only in efforts to understand the different forms of violence through which Israel is defined, but also in addressing questions of intellectual, social and political significance other than those directly related to Israel/Palestine. This is an interdisciplinary course, and we will be drawing on work in anthropology, feminist theory, literature, psychoanalysis, postcolonial studies, political theory, and history. We will also be reading from novels, listening to music, and watching films. 

The course is divided into three sections. The first section is focused on the political context of 1890s-1930s Europe. We will situate the development of the Zionist movement by thinking about it in relation to psychoanalysis and in relation to the different forms of socialism and international feminisms emerging at the time. The second section is focused on World War II and its immediate aftermath. We will address the event of the Holocaust, political and philosophical responses to it, questions of origin, representation, the law and justice. The third section focuses on the concept and contexts of Israel post-1948. We will ask about the significance of different forms of difference both in terms of Israel’s contemporary contexts and in terms of the weight of their genealogies. Students will be evaluated based on attendance, in-class participation, one letter to the editor, reading responses, and two short analytical essays.

HS,3061,HS,Postcolonial Islands,"van Vliet, Netta","This course focuses on islands – geopolitically and conceptually – to consider the significance of postcolonial difference for contemporary political questions about representation, violence, exile and diaspora, climate change, poverty, racialization and sexuality. Islands have long been imagined as sites of fantastic possibility and power, as places of refuge and respite as well as places of horror and dread. They are places imagined as home to cannibals and monsters, but also as idyllic vacations spots and safe havens for shipwrecked sailors. Etymologically, the word island carries with it the meaning of both land and water, and islands are defined as fragments of a whole, and simultaneously as whole unto themselves, raising questions about binaries and boundaries between self and other and about the conceptual topographies of territory, land and water, thresholds between here and there. Islands have been sites ripe for colonial ventures, understood as isolated, insular and susceptible to translation and appropriation but also as resistant, bounded and singular, fertile sites of diversity. Islands have also been significant in religious understandings of them as sites for communion with God or as final places of burial. This course will examine islands in these terms as they have been articulated in the literary imagination, in postcolonial studies and ethnography, and in political theory. Drawing on examples such as Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, J.M. Coetzee’s Foe, The Odyssey, Plato’s Atlantis, Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Shakespeare’s The Tempest, Octave Mannoni’s Prospero and Caliban, Aime Cesaire’s A Tempest, as well as on ethnography in Island Studies (including classic ethnography such as Malinowski’s Trobriand Islands, and recent scholarship such as “The Island Studies Journal” and A World of Islands), we will consider questions about political representation, language and translation, religious, ethnic and sexual difference, the definition of the human, mobility and sovereignty, resistance and domination. Students will be evaluated based on attendance, in-class participation, reading responses, one short analytical essay, and a final exploratory research project that examines Mt. Desert Island in the context of course materials.

The Monday sessions will be a complete dramatic reading of the play involving the whole class, stopping to discuss salient points, with the aim of complete understanding of language, structure and meaning. The Thursday sessions will be a single or double feature of contemporary and classic film adaptations, followed by discussion of the relation between play and film. Sample pairings would be ""Romeo and Juliet"" with Bernstein's ""West Side Story; ""Macbeth"" with Geoffrey Wright's ""Macbeth"" and Kurosawa's ""Throne of Blood,"" ""King Lear"" with Moorhouse's ""A Thousand Acres."" Two written assignments will involve a choice of structural analysis of a play, re-casting Shakespearean scenes or motifs into original short fiction, or selecting and following a Shakespeare play through all its cinematic variations.

Unfortunately, we rarely here about solutions, let alone have the opportunity to create our own solutions for the issues that concern us and inspire us to action.
 
Changing the world takes more than a critical eye for what is wrong, proselytizing a good idea and hope.  There are many factors which contribute to creating social change and in this course we explore what it takes to be a successful change maker in our communities, and thus in the world.  Reversing the lens we use to approach the problems of the world is part of what a Human Ecologist needs to do to understand our challenges:
 
“...social entrepreneurs are uniquely suited to make headway on problems that have resisted considerable money and intelligence.  Where governments and traditional organizations look at problems from the outside, social entrepreneurs come to understand them intimately, from within.”  -- David Bornstein, How To Change The World

Students will perform thorough research into a problem of their choosing, understanding it from within by identifying root causes and other exacerbating factors as well as investigating positive deviance and what people around the world are doing to solve this issue. Through these projects and other readings, students will examine a myriad of problems around the world and look at different strategies people are using to tackle them and create positive social change. The final project for the course will be a concrete proposal for solving the problem they selected.  Students will be evaluated based on their performance, participation and the quality of the projects they produce over the course of the term.

Unfortunately, we rarely here about solutions, let alone have the opportunity to create our own solutions for the issues that concern us and inspire us to action.
 
Changing the world takes more than a critical eye for what is wrong, proselytizing a good idea and hope.  There are many factors which contribute to creating social change and in this course we explore what it takes to be a successful change maker in our communities, and thus in the world.  Reversing the lens we use to approach the problems of the world is part of what a Human Ecologist needs to do to understand our challenges:

HS,4014,HS,"Contemporary Psychology: Body, Mind and Soul","Borden, Richard","This course explores current  theories, research and ideas in psychology.  The core themes of 'body', 'mind' and 'soul' all have a long history of psychological inquiry associated with them.  Yet they are every bit as vital and important today.   Some of the most influential authors in the field continue to struggle with these classical philosophical questions --- and with ways to incorporate state-of-the-art research on them.  In this class, we will read and discuss at least one major new book on each theme.  Ideas from these perspectives will be compared, contrasted and critiqued.  In the final portion of the class, we will look especially at ways in which all three themes can be integrated -- not only in academic psychology -- but within our own experience.  Evaluations will be based on careful reading of all materials, class participation, a series of short papers, and an end-of-term presentation and final paper in each student's area of personal interest.

We examine, as background, the nature and scope of environmental, energy, and resource problems and evaluate the various legal mechanisms available to address those problems.  The course attempts to have students critically analyze the role of law in setting and implementing environmental policy.  We explore traditional common law remedies, procedural statutes such as the National Environmental Policy Act, intricate regulatory schemes, and market-based strategies that have been adopted to control pollution and protect natural resources.  Students are exposed to a wide range of environmental law problems in order to appreciate both the advantages and limitations of law in this context.  Special attention is given to policy debates currently underway and the use of the legal process to foster the development of a sustainable society in the United States.  Students are required to complete four problem sets in which they apply legal principles to a given fact scenario.

Many of the artists we will examine make use of new tools designed for industrial purpose, medical, technological or scientific research. Other artists utilize organic materials to craft their designs.

AD,3015,ADS,Art of the Puppet,"Andrews, Nancy","Puppetry is the art of designing, constructing, and operating puppets, usually for an audience.  A puppet is an articulated figure controlled by external means.  Puppets have been used for entertainment, education, therapy, spectacles and social/political demonstration.  This course will explore both the construction and use of puppets, investigate the theory, history and practice of puppetry, and seek out the role and potential of puppets.  Various types of puppets will be made, including hand puppets, rod puppets, shadow puppets, and large scale puppets.  Students, individually and in collaboration, will create both original and adapted scripts and scenarios for their puppets, exploring relationships between text, story, character and movement of the puppet.  In addition to live work, students may choose to develop puppets for use within film, video or multimedia projects. The course will include readings on puppetry, screenings, presentations, demonstrations, and group discussions.  Students will be evaluated on 1) participation in class discussions and exercises, 2) quality and effort demonstrated through projects/presentations  and, 3) understanding and study of readings and screenings as demonstrated in discussions and projects.

AD,3016,ADS,Land Use Planning I,"Mancinelli, Isabel","In this course we will examine what key physical aspects make communities desirable places to live, work and visit and how principals of sustainability can be integrated into the planning process. New development often undermines a  sense of place and poses threats to environmental resources such as water quality.  Through  analyzing a local town in terms of its natural resources, cultural history, scenic quality and the built environment, students determine how new development and conservation may be balanced. They learn how to use computerized geographic information systems (GIS) as a planning tool in developing their recommendations. Students present their final class project to local community decision-makers. Offered every other year.

Students will explore and discuss the roles and responsibilities of designers as primary crafters of visual messages through promotion, advertising and identity design and investigate the work of artists and designers who appropriate tools of advertising to construct alternative messages outside of, and often in critique of, the commercial realm.
 
This advanced level studio art course combines critical examination of contemporary graphic design practice with studio projects in creative problem solving. Practice in design research, layout and composition, typography, digital imaging and text/image composition will be combined with hands-on studio projects in image generation such as block print, silkscreen, monoprint, instant photography, xerography and collage techniques.

Projects will range from investigations of personal identity and branding to advertising and package design in the retail and socio-political environments. Through studio visits, students will have an opportunity to meet professional artists and designers to discuss first hand process and ethical issues related to their work. Students will be evaluated on conceptual problem solving ability, effectiveness of design solutions, understanding and practice of the incremental process of design, timeliness and quality of work, and thoughtful participation in class discussion and critique.

This course explores some challenges and possibilities in education as a result of historical inequities in the distribution of power, knowledge, and resources, and the increasing mobility of peoples in a global economy.  We will consider questions such as:  What is multicultural, intercultural, and global education?  How do culturally different teaching and learning styles impact notions of academic achievement, school success, and teacher quality? How can student assessments and performance standards respond effectively to cultural differences? How can educators effectively communicate and partner with parents and community members across cultural differences?   What are the legal and moral obligations of teachers in providing equal educational opportunity according to federal and state laws?  We will read theory and research on educating across and about cultural difference, reflect on our own cultural affiliations, and actively explore the dynamics of identity, culture, and power in the teaching-learning relationship and in educational institutions through case discussions and other group activities.  Investigations of the education of self and other will take place through class activities, readings, autobiographical and fiction writing, reflective logs, media analysis, and a field research or curriculum project.

How can a teacher use this knowledge of students and subject matter to plan learning experiences that will engage diverse interests, adapt to a wide range of learning styles and preferences, accommodate exceptional needs, and meet state-mandated curriculum standards?  This course is a required course for prospective secondary school teachers that provides an introduction to the backward design process and diverse assessment strategies.  Students will engage in examining theory and practice designing and implementing curricula and assessments. A service-learning component will provide students with the opportunity to observe and participate in a variety of assessment methods in the subject they aim to teach.  The final project will be a collaboratively designed, integrated curriculum unit, including lesson plans and assessments.

ES,1022,ES,Introduction to Oceanography,"Todd, Sean","Planet Earth is misnamed. Seawater covers approximately 70% of the planet's surface, in one giant all-connected ocean. This ocean has a profound effect on the planet's climate, chemistry, ecosystem, and energy resources. Billions of years ago life began there, in what now we regard as the last unexplored frontier of this planet.  In this course we examine the various disciplines within oceanography, including aspects of geology and sedimentology, chemical, dynamic and biological oceanography. The course concludes with an introduction to marine ecosystems examined at various trophic levels, including phyto/zooplankton, fish and other macrofauna. Fieldwork (weather dependent) includes trips on RV Indigo, trips to intertidal and estuarine ecosystems, and possible visits to the college's islands, Mount Desert Rock and Great Duck Island. Evaluation will be by lab, quizzes and a final paper.

ES,1026,ES QR,Introduction to Chaos and Fractals,"Feldman, David","This course presents an elementary introduction to chaos and fractals.  The main focus will be on using discrete dynamical systems to illustrate many of the key phenomena of chaotic dynamics: stable and unstable fixed and periodic points, deterministic chaos, bifurcations, and universality.  A central result of this study will be the realization that very simple non-linear equations can exhibit extremely complex behavior.  In particular, a simple deterministic system (i.e., physical system governed by simple, exact mathematical rules) can behave in a way that is unpredictable and random, (i.e., chaotic).  This result suggests that there are potentially far-reaching limits on the ability of science to predict certain phenomena.  Students in this class will also learn about fractals---self-similar geometric objects---including the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets.  We will also read about and discuss the development of the field of chaos.  In so doing, we will examine the nature of scientific communities, with a particular eye toward how changes in scientific outlooks occur.  Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to explore the relations between chaos, fractals, and other areas of study such as literature, art, and cultural studies.  Students who successfully complete this class should gain a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the basic ideas of chaos and fractals, a greater understanding of the cultural practice of science, and improved mathematical skills.

But the universe of everyday experience is, at minimum, three-dimensional.  In this course we explore how Calculus can be extended so as to apply to functions of more than one variable, and thus apply to the three-dimensional world.  We will begin by reviewing vectors and functions of several variables.  We will then learn about partial derivatives and gradients and how apply these tools to multivariable optimization.  Turning our attention to integral calculus, we will next cover double and triple integrals and their applications.  We will conclude with a treatment of line integrals, flux integrals, the divergence and curl of a vector field, and Green's, and Stokes's theorems.  Evaluation will be based on class participation and lengthy weekly problem sets.  

To enroll in Calculus III students must have a background in single-variable calculus.  Students who have done IB maths at either the standard or higher level, or either the AB or BC Advanced Placement Calculus tests, are ready for Calculus III, as are students who have had Calc I and II here, or at another college.  Calc III re-visits topics from Calc I and II and extends them to multivariable functions and vector fields.  This is a great class for students who want to review their calculus and take their math to the next level.

ES,3044,ES,Climate and Weather,"Hall, Sarah","This class will explore general weather and climate patterns on global, regional, and local scales.  We will discuss the major forcings driving global climate fluctuations - on both long (millions of years) and short (days) timescales, including natural and anthropogenic processes. We will also learn about basic meteorology and the processes producing some common spectacular optical weather phenomena (rainbows, coronas, cloud-types, etc). Students will complete a term project comprising a photo-documentary journal of the different weather phenomena they observe during the 10-week term. The field component of this course will be self-guided through the observation and documentation of weather phenomena.  Who should take this course: No prior geology/science experience is needed - but expect to do a bit of basic math in this course! The course level is intermediate because it will not cover foundational principles of geology (or other sciences) but instead the course will be integrative and require students to practice both their quantitative and qualitative skills. Take this course if you are passionate or curious about climate change, but do not know much about the science of climate and weather!

ES,3052,ES QR,Thermodynamics,"Feldman, David","Thermodynamics is the area of physics concerned with the behavior of very large collections of particles. Examples include the water molecules in glass of water, the electrons in a wire, or the photons given off by a light bulb. Thermodynamics studies properties of collections of particles that are largely independent of the particles' detail, for example, the tendency for heat to flow from a hot object to a cold one.

This course will begin with a treatment of the first law of thermodynamics and basic thermal physics. Topics to be covered include the conservation of energy, heat and work, the ideal gas, the equipartition of energy, heat capacities, and latent heat. We will then move to the second law of thermodynamics, beginning with a statistical definition of entropy. This will require learning some combinatorics (a mathematical technique for counting) and approximation methods for working with very large numbers. This statistical approach will enable us to understand the origin of the second law of thermodynamics, and will lead naturally to statistical definitions of temperature, pressure, and chemical potential. We will then turn our attention to two broad areas of application. The first of these is heat engines and refrigerators, including heat pumps. The second set of applications involve free energy and chemical equilibrium. Depending on student interest, we will cover batteries and fuel cells, phase transitions, adiabatic lapse rates in meteorology, and nitrogen fixation. Thermodynamics is a broadly applicable field of physics, and so this course should be of relevance to students whose interests are in almost any area of science or engineering, as well as those who wish to gain a general introduction to a field that is one of the pillars of modern physical science. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets and a final research paper, presentation, or lab project.

HS,1015,HS,Introduction to Global Politics,"Stabinsky, Doreen","This is an introductory-level course that will expose students to basic concepts and controversies in international politics and serve as background for more advanced work in the area of international studies.  Through historical readings and current events discussions we will answer questions fundamental to understanding global politics today, such as:  What are the different roles that nation-states and non-governmental organizations play in international politics?  How important are various international institutions (the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ) in shaping the global political landscape?   What exactly is civil society? Inequity defines many political relationships between actors in the global system:  between developed and developing countries; between the rich and poor within those countries; between autonomous political groups and the nation-states in which they reside.  To more deeply understand these relationships, we will examine some of the processes that have led to inequities in the current world political economy, touching on such topics as:  colonialism and national liberation movements of the 20th century, the debt crisis, and the formalization of the international trading system.  We will consider the topics from a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives, including political ecology, international political economy, and economic geography. Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussions, several short and long papers written over the course of the term, and a final project and its presentation to the class.

HS,2017,HS,City/Country: Literary Landscapes 1860-1920,"Waldron, Karen","This class focuses on American fiction from the realist/naturalist period (roughly 1860-1920), a time when enormous changes were occurring in and on the American landscape.  Increasing urbanization, immigration, and industrialization corresponded both with a desire for 'realistic' fiction of social problems, and nostalgic stories of a more 'realistic' rural life.  For the first time there was a national literature, resulting from the capabilities of large publishing houses, urban centers and mass production - but this national literature was acutely self-conscious of regional differences, and especially of the tension between city and country.  As writers tried to paint the American landscape in literature, their works subsumed major social issues to place and formal arguments about the true nature of realistic description.  Examining works that portray factory towns, urban tenements, midwestern prairies, New England villages, and the broad spectrum of American landscapes, we look at how a complex, turbulent, multi-ethnic, and simultaneously urban and rural American culture defined itself, its realism, and thus its gender, class, race, and social relations and sense of values, against these landscapes.  There are two extra, evening classes during week 7 (Short Fiction Week), and a modest lab fee.  Evaluation is based on weekly response papers, two short papers, and a short fiction project, as well as class participation.

HS,2019,HS,Community Planning and Decision Making,"Mancinelli, Isabel","Albert Einstein once observed that ""no problem can be solved from the same consciousness that created it.  We must learn to see the world anew"".  If Einstein's idea is accurate about how humans understand the universe, it is likewise true of how we plan and manage our relationships with the environment.  One of the primary aims of human ecology is to explore new ways to envision human environment relations.  Within its integrative perspective, scientific knowledge and human aesthetics can be combined in ways that enrich human communities as well as value and protect the rest of the living world.  The purpose of this course is to provide students with a foundation of theory and practical skills in ecological policy and community planning.  A broad range of ideas and methodologies will be explored.  Using real examples of current issues - such as sprawl, smart growth, gateway communities, watershed based regional planning, land trusts, and alternative transportation systems.  We will be joined by the actual leaders of these changes locally and state wide in Maine.  We will also examine emerging methodologies that emphasize participatory planning, community capacity-building, and empowering marginalized groups.  These models and ideas will be further compared with prominent approaches and case studies from elsewhere around the country. As a part of current ideas about community planning and policy, the course also introduces small group collaboration techniques, and the use of computers to enhance complex decision processes.  A field component will take advantage of varied external opportunities - including town meetings, conferences, and public events.  Evaluations will be based on class participation, several short research papers, and end of term small group projects.

HS,2049,HS,Marvelous Terrible Place: Human Ecology of Newfoundland,"Todd, Sean","Where is the largest population of humpback whales in the world, the largest caribou herd in North America, the only confirmed Viking settlement in North America, and Paleozoic water bottled for consumption? The remote Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador presents a stunning landscape, an astoundingly rich ecological setting, and a tragic history of poverty amidst an incredible natural resource, the northern cod fishery, that was ultimately destroyed. The province has been alternately invaded or occupied by different groups of Native Americans along with Norseman, Basques, French, British, and the U.S. military, because of its strategic location and rich fishing and hunting grounds. One of the first and one of the last British colonies, this richest of fisheries produced a very class based society, composed of a wealthy few urban merchants and an highly exploited population of fishing families often living on the edge of survival. But within the past 50 years, Newfoundland society has been forced to evolve. The provincial government looks towards oil and mineral exploitation to turn around the economy, while ex-fishermen consider eco- and cultural tourism with growing ambivalence. This then is our setting, and background, for an intense examination of the human ecology of this province; the relationship between humans and their environment, sometimes successful, sometimes otherwise, the struggle between the tenuous grasp of civilization and this marvelous, terrible place. To do this we will discuss various readings, examine case studies and review the natural and human history of this unique province.  Our learning will culminate with a two-week trip to Newfoundland to examine its issues firsthand.  Evaluation will be based on class and field trip participation, responses to reading questions, a field journal, and a final project.

HS,2052,HS,Popular Psychology,"Borden, Richard","Humans have an inherent need to make sense of their lives.  Their search may be simply to improve everyday experience or it may involve a life-long quest for  meaning and wisdom.  Nonetheless, in every age, they have found written advice to address these perennial needs: ranging from the Bhagavad-Gita and the Bible, through Marcus Aurelieus' Meditations and Ralph Waldo Emerson's Self-Reliance AF to the ever-popular, self-help book.  In the past half-century of the New York Times' Best Sellers List, there has usually been one or more popular psychology books on the list.  Hundreds of millions have been sold and read.  Some focus on how to improve relationships, raise children, or build wealth; others promise ways to discover happiness, expand memory, or find a deeper self. Their authors may be serious scholars, well-known psychologists, insightful leaders, or shallow self promoters.  The purpose of this course is to critically examine the literature of popular psychology: to explore why people are or are not so drawn to this literary genre and to analyze its deeper psychological significance.  A further goal is to evaluate how and when they do work or why they don't.  These questions will be guided by an in depth evaluation of the implicit structure of each book, as well as a comparative  mapping of it within the theories and methods of professional psychology.  In order to investigate a broad cross-section of styles and themes, we begin with several 'classic' popular books as a common foundation.  Thereafter, we move on to more varied approaches within small groups and individually.  Evaluations will be based on participation in class discussions, several short papers, shared book reviews, and final paper comparing popular and academic psychology.

It then proceeds to examine two classic approaches to the unconscious:  dreams and love.  Students are expected to keep dream notebooks and to recognize their own unconscious life in the light of readings.  Readings start with the unconscious in its classical formulation according to Freud and Jung.  We read The Interpretation of Dreams and Two Essays in Analytical Psychology.  We consider these themes in fiction using Henry James' The Beast in the Jungle.  We then move to more contemporary writers, particularly James Hillman's The Dream and the Underworld, Michel Foucault's History of Sexuality, and finally consider some of the negative implications of the material in Elaine Scarry's The Body in Pain.

Students will gain both practical and theoretical understandings of how treaties are negotiated and implemented, through case studies of the climate change convention and the Cartagena protocol on biosafety. We will draw on both mainstream and critical theories of international relations when analyzing these negotiations. Students will become familiar with the range of political stances on different treaties of various nations and blocs, and the political, economic, cultural, and scientific reasons for diverging and converging views. We will pay special attention to the growing role played by non-governmental organizations in global environmental politics. We will conclude the course with discussions of some current controversial areas in international environmental politics.

HS,3023,HS,International Wildlife Policy and Protected Areas,"Cline, Ken","""Save the whales""; ""save the tiger""; ""save the rainforest"" - - increasingly wildlife and their habitats are the subject of international debate with many seeing wildlife as part of the common heritage of humankind.  Wildlife does not recognize the political boundaries of national states and as a result purely national efforts to protect wildlife often fail when wildlife migrates beyond the jurisdiction of protection. This course focuses on two principle aspects of international wildlife conservation:  1) the framework of treaties and other international mechanisms set up to protect species; and 2) the system of protected areas established around the world to protect habitat. We begin with an examination of several seminal wildlife treaties such as the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, CITES, migratory bird treaties, and protocols to the Antarctica Treaty.  Using case studies on some of the more notable wildlife campaigns, such as those involving whales and elephants, we seek to understand the tensions between national sovereignty and international conservation efforts.  The Convention on Biological Diversity and its broad prescriptions for wildlife protection provide a central focus for our examination of future efforts.  Following on one of the key provisions in the Convention on Biological Diversity, the second half of the course focuses on international and national efforts to create parks and other protected areas.  In particular we evaluate efforts to create protected areas that serve the interests of wildlife and resident peoples.  Students gain familiarity with UNESCO's Biosphere Reserve model and  the IUCN's protected area classifications.  We also examine in some depth the role that NGO's play in international conservation efforts.  The relationship between conservation and sustainable development is a fundamental question throughout the course.

This course is taught in seminar format in which students read and discuss several environmental policy and history texts that concern the history and future of our federal lands.  We also use primary historic documents and texts to understand the origins of public ownership and management.  We examine the legal, philosophical, ecological, and political problems that have faced our National Parks, wildlife refuges, national forests, and other public lands.  An effort is made to sort out the tangle of laws and conflicting policies that govern these public resources.  Special attention is given to the historic roots of current policy debates.  Evaluation is based upon response papers, a class presentation, participation in class discussions, and a group project looking closely at the historical context and policy implications of a management issue facing a nearby public land unit.

Using sources ranging from secondary sources, historical atlases, aerial surveys, and diaries, we will explore how the culture of apple agriculture in Maine develops over time as part of an interconnected Atlantic World where crops flow back and forth between Britain and the colonies/U.S. over hundreds of years.  Course activities will include fruit exploration and fieldtrips to track down and identify antique varieties, as well as visits to the local farms where a new generation of apple culture is taking shape.  The course will also engage students with the process of cider-making, both sweet and hard, as well as exercises in the preparation, storage, and processing of apples.  Students will be evaluated on their participation in discussion, how they collaborate with others in class projects, and a final individual or collaborative project.

HS,4010,HS,Seminar in Human Ecology,"Borden, Richard","This seminar traces the historical development of human ecology.  We begin by reviewing the seminal works in human ecology, the contributions from biology, and the development of human ecology as a multidisciplinary concept.  Along these lines we compare the various brands of human ecology that have developed through sociology (the Chicago school), anthropology and cultural ecology, ecological psychology, and economics, as well as human ecological themes in the humanities, architecture, design, and planning.  This background is then used to compare the COA brand of Human Ecology with other programs in this country and elsewhere around the world.  Our final purpose is to look at new ideas coming from philosophy, the humanities, biological ecology, and other areas for future possibilities for human ecology.  Evaluations are based on presentations and papers. Offered every other year

It would also be useful to the novel reader as a insider's approach to the structure and purpose of fiction, the relation of author to character, and issues of intentionality. We will be reading first chapters from current novels and studying their opening strategies, then each student will develop plot, character, style and setting ideas for a first novel, followed by writing and revising fifty or sixty pages of their projected work. Other concerns will be narrative viewpoint, handling of time, levels of realism, dialogue techniques, writing habits, motivation & self-discipline, and the relation of fiction to personal experience. Background in creative writing or narrative theory would be helpful but not essential.

The course seeks to provide students with appropriate theoretical tools as well as concrete historical cases from which to examine power dynamics in contemporary Mexico, Central America, and the Andes.  The course also highlights a concrete set of cases through which students can examine the history of political upheaval, revolution, and contestation that has defined the region since independence.  The chronological scope of the class will be from the early nineteenth century up to the late twentieth century.  Students will be asked to take theoretical works about state formation, nationalism and power and examine how such questions could be turned into research projects.  Students will write a series of analytical essays on the course readings to problematize each author's treatment of power and the state.  A final project on one author's theoretical and empirical contribution to the field will serve as a capstone.   The course will focus on discussion of the texts, and students will be evaluated on their discussion skills, reading notes, and written work.  This course is intended for students with prior coursework on Latin American history (e.g. From Native Empires to Nation States, Articulated Identities, and Seminar in Guatemalan History and Culture), and courses in social theory would also be helpful.

We will strive to make connections between texts so as to better understand the nature of and any patterns or themes that shape women's and cross-cultural fictional narration.  Historical perspective, cultural differences, and gender roles will all be taken into consideration as we analyze relatively recent women's fiction by such authors such as Toni Morrison, Maxine Hong Kingston, Gloria Naylor, Linda Hogan, Julie Shikeguni,  Jamaica Kincaid, Nora Okja Keller, Cristina Garcia, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Sigrid Nunez.  Participants will read carefully, prepare and ask questions of each other, write frequent response papers, and carry out a sustained independent project to be presented to the group.  The outside project will focus on one or more additional texts that may be fictional, theoretical, cultural, or historic. The group presentation will put outside texts into broad cultural and historical perspectives and/or discuss them in terms of trends in women's literature, immigrant literature, women's literature of the United States, multicultural narratives, or some other course theme.  Selection of the outside text will give participants the opportunity to fill in perceived gaps in their reading or explore a particular narrative or cultural form in depth.  The reading load for this course is relatively heavy.  Evaluation will focus on preparation, participation, insight, critical thinking, response papers, and the outside project - both its oral presentation and development in an appropriate form (visual, narrative, analytic, curricular, etc.).

HS,4046,HS HY,Lincoln Before the Presidency,"McKown, Jamie","Perhaps one of the most widely evoked figures in modern history, Abraham Lincoln is frequently written about, quoted, and held up as an iconic example in contemporary public debate. Yet most people know little about Lincoln beyond a summary biographical sketch and a short speech or two. This is especially true as it relates to Lincoln's political life before the presidency.

This class is an intensive exploration into Lincoln's political career prior to his election to the presidency in 1860. Students will explore Lincoln's activities as they relate to the debate over slavery, the death of the Whig party, and the ascendancy of the newly formed Republican Party. Class reading and discussion will be driven by a threefold examination of broad historical contexts, biographical materials, and public speech texts. Students will spend an extended period of time on the analysis of the 1858 Senate debates between Lincoln and Stephen Douglas.  While the class will focus intensely on the political events of the 1850's, the class will simultaneously track broader questions of political action in the context of a democratic society.  As a result, students will have the opportunity both to acquire a richer understanding the historical moment that led to Lincoln's rise to power, as well as an opportunity to reflect on the larger issue of putting ""truth"" into political practice.  
     
This course is intended for students with an interest in American history, political action, and public debate. Familiarity with these issues is not a prerequisite for the class. The class will be held in a seminar style environment and will be driven primarily by in-class discussion. There will be an intensive reading load as well as an intensive writing component to the class. Final evaluation will be based on a number of writing assignments, participation in class discussion, and an individual class presentation.

HS,5016,HS HY,Corn and Coffee,"Little-Siebold, Todd","This course explores the rich history of Guatemala through the lens of two vital products, corn and coffee.  The crops provide insight into the global and local dimensions of both historical and contemporary reality there.  The course will cover the history of Guatemala from pre-contact native society through the myriad changes wrought by colonialism, decolonization, the rise of the modern nation state, and the transformations associated with the rise of coffee as a major export crop.  Corn and coffee provide a convenient vantage point from which to examine the social, economic, and cultural dynamics of native society on the one hand and the globally- connected production of coffee on the other.  The course moves from a broad macro perspective on each crop to an intensive exploration of how both are produced in Guatemala.  In this way, class participants will be able to look at how global historical trends in consumption have played themselves out in local communities.  The class will simultaneously be able to look at the processes at work in pueblos throughout Guatemala that root the corn economy into rich cultural and social dynamics that are at the core of communal life.  Using these two crops as a starting point, the class will allow students to develop a holistic and synthetic understanding how Guatemalans live their everyday lives embedded in intensely local realities even as they experience much larger national and international processes.  The course emphasizes attention to the broad global dimensions of corn and coffee's production as well as the fine-grained study of Guatemala's socio-cultural life in historical and anthropological perspective. Through discussions of the books, this seminar-style course seeks to provide students with deep insights into the history of Guatemala while maintaining a sense of the global and regional context.  Intensive readings will provide students with a snapshot of trends in both history and ethnography while broader synthetic analyses of both corn and coffee will embody more popular approaches to the topic.  Students will lead discussions of the readings, write short synthetic essays, and undertake a research project for the class.

Ventures have been for-profit and non-profit, encompassing the range from local businesses to scalable start-ups. Students selected for the Hatchery are required to devote an entire term to launching their venture. Each Hatchery enterprise, whether a team or an individual, must take the course for a minimum of three credits. Along with weekly instructional meetings, students receive office space, supplies, professional services, mentors and potential access to seed capital to develop their ventures. After the initial ten weeks of class, if students decide to continue their enterprises, they have access to the Hatchery space and resources for an additional nine months. 

The Hatchery takes place in three phases:
--Application:  Students apply for a position in the Hatchery over winter term. 
--Rapid Prototype:  The ten weeks of the Hatchery course. Students create a rapid prototype to test their ventures in the marketplace. These prototypes vary widely depending on the type of ventures.
--Creating an Enterprise Structure:  During the ten weeks of the course, students will have weekly assignments that introduce key elements in an organizational structure and highlight operational considerations that are universal amongst enterprises.
--Development:  The following 9-months. Students have access to the Hatchery space and resources to continue developing their enterprises.

Most recently, islands have served as an important metaphor in the development of conservation biology. Maine is blessed with a plethora of islands -between 4500 and 6000 at the last count- and the history and pre-history of these islands is intimately entwined with that of the continent itself. This course examines historical and current interpretations of island biogeography and the interplay between natural and human history and human ecology. The class will be taught as a combination of term-time seminar and in the field, based on the College's field station on Great Duck Island and the College's research vessel. During the Spring term we will be meeting regularly to examine the theoretical basis of Island Biogeography and islands as the subject of scientific and literary discussion since Aristotle. Readings will include Darwin, Alfred Russell Wallace, and contemporary authors.  In late August we will re-convene for the field component of the class. During the first half of this component, we will be focusing primarily on Great Duck Island and its immediate surroundings, learning and applying theoretical approaches to islands' landscapes, with extensive reading from the primary literature. During the second half of the class, we will move further afield, exploring a variety of islands in eastern Maine, and relating our observations to theoretical predictions. Ultimately we hope to travel to Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy to observe a large island community, see the traditional weir fishery, and observe firsthand migrating right and humpback whales, and northern seabirds.

In conjunction with readings and class discussions, students will use a term-long study of a local stream to learn about the threats facing rivers in the United States and the legal and policy mechanisms for addressing these threats. In addition, the class will take an extended field trip to western Massachusetts to gain first-hand knowledge of the tremendous impact river manipulation can have on a social and ecological landscape.

AD,3017,NA,Dramatic Writing for Stage and Screen,"Lepcio, Andrea","This is an intermediate creative writing course for students interested in writing for theater, film and television. We will read published and unpublished plays, screenplays and tv shows from up and coming writers currently off and on Broadway and in film/television as well as selected plays and screenplays/shows from the cannon based on student interest. Playwrights (and screenwriters), like cartwrights and shipwrights, are all skilled builders of vehicles meant to move people from one place to another. We will explore dramatic structure from the perspective of the audience. Whether writing linear narratives, collage or non-linear plays and films, there is a rhythm to dramatic writing that can be studied. We will make a conscious study of form to free us to write what we are driven to write. Through reading, analysis and writing, we will investigate the dramatic elements of character, conflict, language and theme. The course will include practical writing exercises to motivate and progress the writing from first draft through revision to rehearsal draft. Students will be encouraged to develop productive writer habits and self-discipline. Class time will be divided between hearing students’ work and discussing work we’ve read. We will develop our listening skills when hearing our own and colleagues’ work. We will explore the role of critique in new script development and refine a process that works for us. Students will be expected to bring new pages in to each class building to a complete first draft of a full-length play or screenplay (of any length) by the end of the course. Evaluation will be based on the student’s dedication to developing a writing practice as well as the submitted script. We will conclude with a reading series to give each student the opportunity to hear his or her work in front of an invited audience.

ES,5038,NA,Tutorial: Ecology and Evolution of Parasites,"Hess, Helen","Parasites live on the surface or within the bodies of a host, feeding off host fluids or tissues.  Because parasites do not directly kill the host, a parasitic infection may persist indefinitely, sometimes decades in the case of long-lived hosts.  Parasites include tiny, single-celled organisms as well as worms that can reach many meters in length.  This course will explore the biology of parasites, with a focus on those species that affect humans and domestic animals.  Some of the most prevalent human diseases, such as malaria and schistosomiasis, are caused by parasites.  Students will learn about the evolution o f complex life histories and the various means of evading the host’s immune system employed by parasites.

HS,4047,HS,Waste,"van Vliet, Netta","The term ""waste"" has varied definitions; it can suggest excess material not put to use, garbage, time or objects that are not made productive or useful, and that which is thrown away. Waste is both a verb and a noun, and the term often carries moral or ethical undertones; time should not be wasted, neither should food nor material goods, and of course, life itself should not be wasted. Waste should be reduced or transformed through consumption or recycling. Waste can occasion disgust and outrage, but even if less acknowledged, also fascination, desire and pleasure.  Time spent idle is often time considered ""wasted."" Waste is also often understood as destructive and as the product of destruction. At the same time, waste can also be a necessary by product of its opposites. Psychoanalysis has drawn attention to feces association with gold and the notion of the gift of waste in the formation of subjectivity. Political economy, postcolonial studies, anthropology  and feminist theory have all addressed histories of abjection, notions of excrement, disposable populations, and the ways in which humans have dealt with literal waste and those materials and lives that become understood as waste. In this regard, understandings of waste have been central for notions of value, productivity, desire, cleanliness and filth, inside and outside, and the place of difference. In this course, we will examine some of the varied ways in which waste has been understood - in terms of political economy, political theory, postcolonial studies and feminist theory, addressing waste in terms of identity, the natural environment, value, and the formation of what counts as human. Readings will include texts by Karl Marx, Frantz Fanon, Georges Bataille, Julia Kristeva, Sigmund Freud, Dominque Laporte, Mary Douglas, Jacques Lacan, Norman O. Brown, Sophia Stamatopoulou-Robbins, William Rathje and Cullen Murphy, Kathleen Millar, Hannah Arendt, Carl Schmitt, Kevin Bales, Paul Ricoeur, Ranjana Khanna, and Françoise Vergès.

ES,3063,ES,Seminar in Climate Change,"Hall, Sarah","In this seminar-style class, students will learn about climate change over multiple timescales. We will discuss the major forcings driving global climate fluctuations - on both long (millions of years) and short (days) timescales, both natural and anthropogenic in nature. Students will learn about the main  paleoclimate methodologies being used today to quantify and understand past climates over tens to millions of years. We will also discuss current modeling efforts to predict future climate scenarios. This course will use primary scientific literature to broadly explore some of the major topics related to climate change including: paleoclimate methods, modeling, feedbacks, atmosphere-ocean interaction, and predicted environmental changes. We will discuss some of the broader impacts of climate change (stresses on resources, water, food, economies, land-use, etc.) according to student interest and expertise. Beyond discussions in class, students will be required to attend lectures by a few visiting experts in the field. Students will take turn leading discussions on specific topics at least twice during the term. Assessment will be based on written responses to readings and a final project and presentation.

AD,5025,ADS,Strangers and Performance,"Baker, Jodi","This course explores the dynamics of stranger interactions across disciplines and in a variety of contexts, first by gaining a basic understanding of how the topic has been considered by scientists, social theorists, architects and city planners over the last century but also by understanding how these particular social dynamics fundamentally connect to work in theatre and in art. Through a series of practical experiments, students discern when, why and how stranger interactions are meaningful, how they differ in urban and rural contexts and how that meaning is tied to the shared work ethic at the heart of the theatrical contract. We will consider the politics of public and private spaces as well as key strategies in staging urban centers, national parks, schools, museums, and theatres. We’ll also examine stranger archetypes and related terminology like mob-rule, groupthink, bystander effect and collective consent. Students will explore the inherent risks and rewards that stem from personal interactions with strangers and they will study existing and emerging art, performance and technology projects that attempt to incite these interactions. Students will also develop their own ideas for public performance and new theatre technology. Readings will likely include work from Kio Stark, Paul Auster and Sophie Calle, Bertolt Brecht, Peter Brook, Roland Barthes, William H. Whyte, George Simmel, Anne Bogart, Susan Sontag, Jorge Luis Borges. Visual, theatre and performance artists may include Andrew Schneider, Richard Renaldi, Natalia Koliada and Nicolai Khalezin, Marina Abramovic, Chris Burden, Rotozaza, Mammalian Diving Reflex and Complex Movements. The course requires a large amount of off-campus work and at least one weekend field trip. Evaluation will be based on consistent engagement with course topics and the class blog, successful completion of a series of solo and collaborative fieldwork assignments and a comprehensive final project w/process essay.

Desert Island and Maine. The course will include weekly readings from mineralogy and petrology textbooks and web-resources. Students will complete a rock/mineral lab each week and quizzes every other week. We will visit a few local field sites and as well as conduct one weekend-long collecting trip to sites throughout Maine. The students will be evaluated based on their performance on the weekly labs and quizzes, the completeness and accuracy of their collection, and a final project on the rocks and minerals of one select MDI field site. The course fee covers the cost of a weekend collecting field trip, and some field and lab supplies.

HS,1014,HS,Feminist Theory in a Transnational Frame I,"van Vliet, Netta","This course introduces students to some of the central texts and genealogies of feminist thought, with a focus on transnational feminist theory. We will address periods of feminist thought that have been significant in shaping the concerns of transnational feminisms, including 1970s U.S. feminism, French feminism, postcolonial theory, and Marxist thought.  Over the course of the term, we will consider how differences across national borders have informed discussions about transnational feminist solidarity. We will examine how feminist theory can help us think about the following: kinship; reproduction; the law and justice; human rights discourse, political economy, racialized and other forms of difference; existence and the subject; the relation between individual and group; the relation between terms such as ""gender"" and ""sex;"" and the varied currencies the terms ""queer"" and ""feminist"" have carried in different national and transnational contexts. 

The course will explicitly address debates in feminist theory about the following topics: the ""sex/gender distinction;"" histories and politics of the term ""rape;"" political representation, the juridical and the nation-state in the contexts of religious and cultural differences around practices such as veiling, circumcision/genital mutilation; and questions of labor, prostitution and sex work. The course draws on work in French Feminist Theory, Queer Theory, Postcolonial Studies, Psychoanalysis, Continental Philosophy, Cultural Anthropology, and Diaspora Studies. Readings will include texts by Gayle Rubin, Luce Irigaray, Elizabeth Grosz, Simone de Beauvoir, Ranjana Khanna, Monique Wittig, Judith Butler, Gayatri Spivak, Sigmund Freud, Friedreich Engels, Shulamith Firestone, Alexandra Kollontai, Emma Goldman, bell hooks, Karen Engle, Catherine McKinnon, Drucilla Cornell, Ratna Kapur, Sarah Franklin, Daniel Boyarin, Henry Louis Gates, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Shoshana Felman, Saba Mahmood, Diana Fuss, and Chandra Mohanty.

AD,1031,ADS,Beginning Drawing,"Foley, Sean","This course provides an introduction to basic freehand drawing with an emphasis on drawing from observation. The student is introduced to a wide range of drawing methods, media and concepts, while developing perceptual skills and an ability to utilize drawing as a tool for thinking, expression, invention, and communication.  The learning in this course is rooted in an intensive, studio based art making experience through which one will gain the necessary skills to begin creating works of art within a historically and culturally aware context.  This studio course prepares each student for the careful interpretation and evaluation of their own work, that of their peers, and artwork of current or historical significance. This capacity for interpretation and evaluation is made possible through an instructional emphasis on learning to see and translating what is seen during the act of drawing.  Students will be evaluated on their studio work, participation, articulation of concepts, and degree of improvement over the term.

HS,1049,HS,Introduction to Latin American Literature: 20th C Fiction,"Mahoney, Daniel","From the metaphysical landscapes of Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar to the alienated anti-cities of María Louisa Bombal and Gabriel García Márquez, Latin American fiction writers expanded the shores of narrative and, in doing so, illustrated the power of language to create and define reality.  In the ""Boom"" years (roughly 1950s-1980s), Latin American novelists sought to create books that, while being worlds unto themselves, richly illustrated the complex history of the Americas.   These are works of origins, colonization, exploitation, brutality, magic, love, loss, and struggles to survive. The ""Post Boom"" novelists looked to class struggle, the power structures of gender relationships, and urban poverty in order to weave new narratives and ways of seeing the postcolonial world.  As an introductory course, we will familiarize ourselves with the varied landscapes of Latin American fiction.  We will learn to analyze and understand literary works in historical and cultural context.  We will look to the words of: Borges, Cortázar, Bombal, Márquez, Bolaño, Allende, Donoso, Valenzuela, Rulfo, and Arriaga to aid us on our journey.  Students will be evaluated on completion of a midterm essay,  a final project, and class participation.

Divergent aesthetic ideologies in Romantic Art will be examined in relationship to both major trends and minor currents of intellectual thought during the period 1780-1840 in Europe, with an emphasis placed largely on German Romanticism. Taken together, many of the literary and philosophical texts associated with the movement have been understood as fundamental critiques of rationality; however, it is the less celebrated illustrations found in scientific treatises and works of art not acknowledged in the canon of the visual arts, as well as images embedded in various forms of printed matter, which effectually capsize Enlightenment aesthetic theories and provide impetus to the development of Realism. Although the body of scholarly work that studies the interstices of Romantic art, literature, and music is enormous, the course will narrow the scope by focusing on certain works as sites of a particular pictorial kind of representational transdisciplinarity.

Students will develop a basic understanding of the materials and techniques of the painter and their application. Through a sequence of exercises ranging from color studies to observational still life painting to more experimental projects focusing on the medium, the student will gain a solid foundation towards making paintings. This course is about painting in its most basic and fundamental sense. Emphasis is placed on learning a variety of painting skills, developing a basic awareness of color theory and auxiliary craftsmanship such as building stretchers, stretching canvas, priming, etc. Students will work towards an informed perceptual and thoughtful expression of a subject using the medium and techniques of painting. Class time will also include lectures and demonstrations directly pertaining to these concerns in order to provide art historical examples and strategies for proceeding with painting exercises and assignments. Students will be assigned readings and discuss them in relation to their development and the course in general. Evaluation will be based on painting projects, participation and articulation of concepts as demonstrated in critiques and short written responses that evidence engagement with course topics.

HS,3063,HS,Contemporary Rhetorical Theory,"McKown, Jamie","This seminar will provide students with a very broad introductory overview of the varying fields and theories that encompass the contemporary study of rhetoric and public discourse. This includes how various authors have approached the questions of text, speaker, form/content, audience, knowledge, cultural context, and strategies of discourse. What unites all of these diverse strands of thought is how each approaches the nature and function of symbols, linguistic or otherwise, as communicative practices. While the central purpose of the course is to introduce students to the field of rhetorical theory, it also aims to do so in ways that will help complement their individual advanced interdisciplinary projects. As such, while there will be a strong foundational core set of readings, some elements of emphasis will shift (within a limited range) from term to term depending on the background and interests of the students enrolled. This might involve drawing more heavily from fields closely related to, and intertwined with, rhetoric such as argument theory, semiotics, cultural studies, critical discourse analysis, and linguistic anthropology. Some of the theorists covered include: Burke, Farrell, Weaver, Perelman, Gaonkar, Fisher, Foucault, Zarefsky, Richards, Bakhtin, Leff, Toulmin, McGee, Saussure, Barthes, Condit, Bitzer, and Vatz. Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussion, short analysis essays, and a final more extensive independent profile of a theorist, theory, or body of work.

HS,3064,HS,Possession and the Human,"van Vliet, Netta","This course examines the concept of the human through an exploration of the concept of possession. Contemporary understandings of the human have been influenced by the political frameworks of European modernity and its philosophical roots, all the way back to Aristotle’s claim that what differentiates the human from other animals is the capacity for speech, which is also what, he argued, makes the human a “political animal. “ Within this history, categories of difference internal and external to European political community, including women, colonized, slaves, homosexuals, Jews, and the insane, have been considered as less than fully human. In contrast, the fully human has been historically defined in terms of possession of one’s self through the possession of reason, property, territory, autonomy and the capacity for self-representation through language. 

Over the course of the term, we will examine how those who have been defined as less than fully human challenge oppositions through which the idea of the self-possessed, autonomous human has been defined – oppositions of mind and body, reason and madness, thought and emotion, masculine and feminine, object and subject, religious and secular, and thus also human and animal. Doing so will allow us to rethink concepts such as “rights,” “consent,” “self-representation,” “value,” “autonomy,” “transparency,” “equality,” “freedom,” and “community.” What might it mean to rethink political claims made in the name of “humanity” in terms of notions of dispossession and being possessed (by language, madness, desire, divine forces or other forms of difference) ? What might it mean to think about relating to others and the self through difference rather than sameness? What might it mean for our understandings of the relation between art and politics if we think about politics as based on translation rather than on self-representation and inclusion? Drawing on psychoanalysis, anthropology, postcolonial studies, political economy, literature, religion and feminist theory, this course considers states such as hysteria, melancholia, speaking in tongues, and ecstasy, as well as states of slavery, colonialism, and poverty to consider the political, social and environmental implications of how we define the human.

Because each rendition of the class focuses on new source material, new production methods and concepts, students may receive credit for this course multiple times. Students research, rehearse, and produce a performance for the public in collaboration with a faculty director. The material and pedagogical focus of the course changes with each successive rendition. The number of students enrolled in the course varies depending upon the demands of the project. Students with any or no experience in theater are welcome but priority is based on seniority and/or specific academic investment in the given project, process or subject matter.

As a result of this tragedy, new approaches and methodologies to economic development are emerging, and represent some of the most important, dynamic, and controversial theories in all of economics. This course examines these new perspectives on economic development. We will briefly contextualize the new by reviewing ""old"" economic development, then move on to theories that emphasize very place-based, country-specific approaches to how economies develop; this will involve examining the specific roles of capital accumulation, capital flows (including foreign exchange, portfolio capital, foreign direct investment, and microfinance), human capital, governance, institutions (especially property rights, legal systems, and corruption), geography and natural resource endowments, industrial policy (e.g. free trade versus dirigiste policies), and spillovers, clustering, and entrepreneurship. The course will involve a rigorous mix of economic modeling, careful application of empirical data (including both historical analysis and cross-sectional studies; students with no exposure to econometrics will receive a brief introduction) and country studies.

ES,3061,ES,Functional Plant Morphology,"Morse, Suzanne","Despite uniform rules of development, seed plants exhibit an incredible range of forms including succulent cacti, bug-eating sundews, dainty annuals, and leafless parasites.  These differences in form often are correlated with habitat and life history parameters such as nutrient and water availability, herbivores, light quality, and modes of perennation.  In this course we begin by examining the morphological development and organization of seed plants from inception in the seed to reproductive maturity.  With this general developmental framework, we then examine whole plant and organ level patterns of variation, modification, and ecological specialization that underlie the variation in form observed today.  Evaluations are based on laboratory quizzes, paper, midterm, and final exam.

HS,4053,HS,"Economics of Cooperation, Networks & Trust","Taylor, Davis","Economics is slowly expanding from equilibrium-based, atomistic optimization, through dyadic strategic interaction, to the consideration of networks and complexity. At the same time, it is beginning to incorporate more complex human motivations beyond simple optimization as means of explaining economic outcomes. This course captures these trends by the study of the economics of cooperation, networks, and trust. We will focus on four major ways of understanding cooperation: individual optimization, strategic optimization, institutions, and embedded social relationships (networks), and we will apply cooperation to the contexts of commonly held resources (such as fisheries and climate), networks and strategic alliances, and formal economic organizations (cooperatives). After an introduction to the relevant issues and an examination of the standard neoclassical approach of optimization (with cooperation as part of the choice set), we will enrich our understanding of group cooperation through the examination of social capital, tacit knowledge, and common pool resources. We will then have a brief exposure to game theoretic approaches to conceptualizing strategic behavior, along with graph theory as a means of conceptualizing networks. With these tools in hand, we will examine the role of networks in economic contexts such as the networks of Emilia Romagna, the Mondragón complex, and worker-owned businesses in the United States and Canada. This course will be of interest to students interested in business and organizational management, natural resource management, sociology, community development, globalization, social movements, economic democracy, and a host of other topics. Evaluation will be based on participation in classroom discussions, several major assignments, and responses to reading questions.

This long history of cultural and economic dependence on fisheries makes the region particularly vulnerable to fisheries decline, such as the collapse of the sardine and cod fisheries. Recent trends in the lobster, clam, scallop, and elver fisheries, as well as aquaculture, show various levels of instability and risk. At the same time, numerous initiatives in the region focus on revitalizing and stabilizing fisheries, while enhancing community resilience. This class uses a variety of inter-disciplinary approaches to examine the relationships among marine resources, fisheries policy, harvesters, and communities. We are interested in examining the relationships within this linked social-ecological system, and use historical data, current documents, interviews and oral histories to examine the human-ecological relationships among residents, policy, and resources. We also will examine new economic initiatives in these communities, including ecotourism, aquaculture, and renewable energy. We have several individuals coming to campus to discuss issues with the class, and we will take several field trips (including an overnight to the Cobscook Bay area) to Downeast communities.  Evaluation will be based on several assignments during the term, including an oral history, sets of essay questions, and research on a fishery.

HS,5039,HS HY,"Equal Rights, Equal Voices: The Rhetoric of Woman Suffrage","McKown, Jamie","This seminar will provide an in-depth exploration of public speech texts by a wide array of 19th century woman suffrage activists in the United States. This includes works by those individuals most often associated with the first wave of the movement including: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Ernestine Rose, Lucy Stone, Anna Dickinson, Lucretia Coffin Mott, Adelle Hazlett, Victoria Woodhull, Anna Julia Cooper, and others. There will be a heavy emphasis on the close reading of primary source materials as students encounter these speakers ""in their own words."" There are five main goals of this seminar. First, to familiarize students with the works of prominent suffrage and equal rights activists from the period. Second, to help illuminate how the ideas, choices, narratives, and arguments reflected in these texts have some relation to contemporary discourses of gender, power, and equality. Third, to offer students the opportunity to conduct close textual readings of significant texts in the field of public address. This seminar is rooted in what might be described as an experiential, grassroots approach to rhetorical criticism, one that is unconstrained by the needs of overly deterministic reading strategies. We will focus more on building a ""theory of the case"" from the ground up and through the eyes of the seminar participants, rather than subjecting each case to the demands of a predetermined comprehensive model of rhetorical action. The fourth goal of the class is to offer students the first hand opportunity to conduct their own “recovery” projects with the aim of locating, transcribing, documenting, and presenting to the class new variations of texts from the period that have been previously undocumented or left unaccounted for. In doing so, students will learn basic techniques for exploring the types of digitized historical collections that have emerged in only the past few years. The final goal for the seminar is to prompt an even broader series of questions about the relationship between text, society, and the ""public."" These are questions that would obviously be salient for students of all interests. Class sessions will be organized as a weekly three hour seminar and will be predominantly discussion driven. Students will be responsible for presenting certain works and will also lead some of our discussions. Assignments will emphasize critical, reflective and analytical writing. Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussion, short written response papers, several longer essays, individual presentations, and a final ""recovery"" project.

ES,1056,ES QR,Physics and Mathematics of Sustainable Energy,"Feldman, David","In this course students will learn content and skills so that they can participate effectively in sustainable energy projects, make personal and community decisions that reduce carbon emissions, and work in ventures in sustainable energy.  Additionally, this course will be useful for those interested in energy and climate policy, either internationally or domestically.  We will begin with a quick overview of current CO2 emissions levels and look at how this is related to energy use.  We will then turn our attention to basic ideas from physics, including the definition of energy and the difference between energy and power.  The bulk of the course will consist of a survey of different forms of energy consumption and generation.  Throughout, we will quantitatively analyze technology from both a local and global point of view.  For example, we will calculate how much electricity one can generate on a rooftop, and we will also examine the role that solar PV could play toward the goal of eliminating fossil fuel use worldwide.  In a unit on financial mathematics, students will learn about the time value of money and several ways of quantifying investments, including ROI (return on investment) and IRR (internal rate of return).  Students will apply these financial tools in several short case studies.  If time permits, we may also cover negative emissions technologies and the electrical grid, including grid stability issues and the potential of smart-grid technology.

MD,2012,NA,Failure,"Baker, Jodi","Failure looms large in society. Is it a badge of honor, an inextricable part of a process, a means to success or rather something to be feared and ashamed of? In this course, students will explore how notions of failure align and contrast between gender, class and culture. We will also explore if conceptions of failure differ substantially among the artistic, business and other communities. In divergence with historical attitudes, today's entrepreneurs are implored to ""fail cheap and fail fast"" and events, like FailCon, celebrate failure as a badge of honor. In art failure is simply inherent to process. And yet, the fear and sting of failure is real for everyone. Through a series of practicums, readings, guest lectures and discussions this class will explore various aspects of failure. Students will be evaluated on class participation, a series of solo and group projects, selections from a failure journal and contributions to a shared class blog.

Projects will examine the evolution of modernist painting and its emphasis away from representational, perspectival space towards abstract, optical flatness. More generally, we will be examining the relationships between form and content and ways that students can develop a sustainable, serious and personalized studio ""practice"". The aim is to cultivate informed, thoughtful perceptions and expression of a subject through the medium, techniques, culture, and history of painting. The technical emphasis is on developing painting skills appropriate to the student’s subject and a rigorous experimentation with media and techniques. Auxiliary craftsmanship such as creating mediums and grounds, building stretchers and panels, as well as stretching and priming canvas will be a significant part of this course. Students will receive basic woodshop training and will be required to make their own supports this term. Students will be evaluated on the quality of their construction, stretching, and priming in addition to their participation, verbal articulation, and studio work. This course will also feature demonstrations, a field trip, art historical slide presentations and readings of relevant artists and writers that provide a historical and/or philosophical context for our work this term. Scholarly research and constructive questioning will be stressed, along with developing a work ethic appropriate for pursuing painting in serious manner. All students will be able to coherently articulate their ideas concerning their process, technique, work, vision, and an art historical context for their work.

AD,5026,AD,Negotiating Wonder,"Foley, Sean","Writer and ecologist Edith Cobb suggested, ""The ability to look upon the world with wonder is a technique and essential instrument in the work of the poet, the artist, or the creative thinker."" This advanced course will explore wonder as the poetic source of curiosity and knowledge. We will consider wonder as a visual phenomenon and engage it through transdisciplinary readings within the fields of the arts, science, natural history, education and philosophy in order to develop a structural means to frame and personalize the slippery and subjective experience of wonder as an antecedent to knowledge. Our discussions will be purposefully broad in order to develop techniques, provocations and general criteria to explore a wide variety of concepts useful towards engaging the inexplicable. We will discuss wonder in relation to its associated conditions of the marvelous, the fantastic, the uncanny, the horrible, the terrible, and the abject. These highly subjective and elusive concepts will be examined as ""conditions"" of wonder. We will not seek to concretely ""explain"" these rich concepts but use them actively, as immersive and interrogative tools that students can exert to articulate or provoke a sense wonder in service of developing better questions. The reading load for this course is heavy. A high level of class participation, a consistent demonstration of the close reading of assigned texts, and a commitment to thoughtful listening during group discussions are the course standards for excellence. Additional criteria include response papers and a sustained final independent project to be presented to the group. There will also be a required field trip to the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams, MA to tour the art exhibition ""Explode Everyday: An Inquiry into the Phenomenon of Wonder"".

When is language a mechanism for social and political oppression and when does language facilitate liberation? How do multicultural, intersectional, transgender, and queer approaches inform feminist politics? How do queer philosophers challenge the theoretical orthodoxies of identity, gender, and sexuality?

HS,1053,NA,Intimate Partner Violence: Dynamics and Community Response,"Gagnon da Silva, Pamela","From a historical perspective domestic violence has been noted as primarily a ""women’s issue"". We now recognize the misuse of power and control in relationships as a complex and prevalent social issue that profoundly impacts our society as a whole. To address the complexity of domestic violence we must strive toward changing the belief systems that allow this problem to exist. Together we will explore these belief systems by examining the aspects of culture that shape and support domestic violence on individual, community, institutional, and global levels. We will review the history of the domestic violence movement, including its roots in the women’s movement and how that movement grew into a network of victim-centered services and community-based advocacy responses. As a student you will learn how best to respond to victims of intimate partner violence, and how to apply the core principles of individual, community, institutional, and social change advocacy. You will be challenged to consider and reflect upon your own beliefs and cultural lenses throughout the course. The class format includes lectures, role-plays, media presentations, interviews with guest speakers, group work, and discussions. Opportunities will be provided for students to reflect upon experiences, to practice skills, and apply new learning through community and cultural change projects. Students will be evaluated on their critical thinking, analysis, and synthesis of the course goals and objectives as demonstrated by participation in class activities (responsiveness to required and suggested readings and materials, guest and peer generated discussion), personal culture analysis (personal reflection, self-evaluation).

ES,4043,ES,Environmental Geoscience Field Methods: Eastern CA,"Hall, Sarah","This 4-week summer field course will take place during the months of June-July (dates TBD). A maximum of 8 COA students will join peers from University of San Francisco and Mt San Antonio College for a combined cohort of ~24 students and 4 faculty to study and work in the eastern Sierra Nevada region of California. In this field methods-based course, topics will include hydrology, geomorphology, geology, ecology as well as the human dimension of each topic (education, policy, hazards, resources). This region of CA is a perfect natural laboratory for students to engage in classic field activities such as geologic and geomorphic mapping that are critical to helping students develop geospatial skills. The region hosts major active faults, striking variations in relief, a rich glacial history, a wide range of bedrock lithologies spanning multiple timescales, as well as resource availability (e.g. geothermal, salts) and scarcity (e.g. water), and susceptibility to different types of geohazards (e.g. rockfalls, volcanic, earthquakes, drought, fires). We will also take advantage of the opportunities in the region to experience applied geoscience through research opportunities and engagement with local stakeholders (YNP and SSCZO). Field exercises will be designed to capitalize on existing infrastructure at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory (SNARL), the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory (SSCZO) and Yosemite National Park (YNP). Field exercises and exchanges with local stakeholders will provide opportunities to earn badges that represent mastery of skills and content knowledge relevant to potential environmental-STEM careers. Students will be assessed based on their performance on field exercises and a final field report. This course is linked to a follow-up Professional Development Seminar that students will take upon returning to COA in the fall term.

HS,4054,HS,Philosophies of Love,"Cox, Gray","This course investigates the intellectual history of  concepts of love that provide  origins for notions of it central in our time.  Is love the key to giving meaning to our individual lives? Is it a transformative power that can empower and heal us and our societies? How are the many different concepts of it related? To what extent are these concepts grounded in biological, historical, philosophical or spiritual truths – or mere reflections of collective myths, self delusions or manipulative deceptions?  How can we as individuals most fully realize ourselves? How can our society best promote flourishing lives and how can this be brought about? The theme of love winds like an Ariadnean thread through the labyrinth of  the history of ideas about the nature of  self, Other, community, knowledge, reality and ethics. The class uses overview materials from intellectual historians like de Rougemont,  Singer and May. It picks away through central passages in that labyrinth by reading key selections from Plato,  New Testament writers, Medieval poets, Nietzsche, de Beauvoir, Irigary, Gandhi, King, Levinas, Thich Nhat Hanh, Mortimer-Sandilands, pop culture and others. Class format relies on seminar discussion with occasional short lectures. Goals of the course are to advance students’ abilities to critically analyze texts in context in intellectual history, and to advance understanding of nuanced ways key ideas in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and social-change theories inform and are informed by concepts including: eros, philia, agape, courtly love (fin amour), love force/satyagraha, romantic love, ahimsa, and compassion. Students will be responsible for leading seminar  sessions. There will be one problem set, two short papers and a term project presented in class as well as developed in a final paper of 15-20 pages.

HS,4054,HS,Philosophies of Love,"Cox, Gray","This course investigates the intellectual history of  concepts of love that provide  origins for notions of it central in our time.  Is love the key to giving meaning to our individual lives? Is it a transformative power that can empower and heal us and our societies? How are the many different concepts of it related? To what extent are these concepts grounded in biological, historical, philosophical or spiritual truths – or mere reflections of collective myths, self delusions or manipulative deceptions?  How can we as individuals most fully realize ourselves? How can our society best promote flourishing lives and how can this be brought about? The theme of love winds like an Ariadnean thread through the labyrinth of  the history of ideas about the nature of  self, Other, community, knowledge, reality and ethics. The class uses overview materials from intellectual historians like de Rougemont,  Singer and May. It picks away through central passages in that labyrinth by reading key selections from Plato,  New Testament writers, Medieval poets, Nietzsche, de Beauvoir, Irigary, Gandhi, King, Levinas, Thich Nhat Hanh, Mortimer-Sandilands, pop culture and others. Class format relies on seminar discussion with occasional short lectures. Goals of the course are to advance students’ abilities to critically analyze texts in context in intellectual history, and to advance understanding of nuanced ways key ideas in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and social-change theories inform and are informed by concepts including: eros, philia, agape, courtly love (fin amour), love force/satyagraha, romantic love, ahimsa, and compassion. Students will be responsible for leading seminar  sessions. There will be one problem set, two short papers and a term project presented in class as well as developed in a final paper of 15-20 pages. Includes a lab session for viewing films and television and discussing student work.

The course will focus on several genocides or ethnic cleansings from different parts of the globe: for example, toward American Indians in the US, Chinese in Nanking, Jews, Roma and others during the Holocaust, Muslims in Bosnia & Herzegovina and Tutsi people (and a smaller number of Hutus) in Rwanda. Students will be evaluated based on short written responses to readings, in class discussion, two papers and a final project. The final project will explore the topics in the course through fiction, poetry, art, film, advocacy, interviews or other forms of expression. The course readings will be a mix of scholarly writing about genocide, first person accounts and perhaps some fiction and poetry. We will also watch and discuss videos. Class sessions will involve discussions with all of us together and also in small group discussions between students.

HS,1056,W,Writing Seminar I: Exposition with a Business Focus,STAFF,"Designed to serve the overall academic program, this course like other sections of Writing Seminar I focuses on formal writing based on rhetorical principles of exposition. This course differs in that its focus is business writing-the writing students in the Hatchery Program and other sustainability-related courses need to communicate effectively as professionals. Like other sections of Writing Seminar I, the course concentrates on the writing process: prewriting, writing, and rewriting. Assigned readings both illustrate how to use these rhetorical principles and develop students' analytical skills. Students learn how to write clear, precise, and unambiguous business plans, cover letters, power point presentations, crowdfunding websites, and tweets. The practice-oriented approach gives students the opportunity to acquire skills they will need as professionals to communicate effectively and concisely to specific audiences.  Through a research paper or case study, the course introduces students to library research and academic documentation. The course emphasizes peer review, revision, regular conferences, and class presentations. Evaluation is based on the quality of revised papers in the final portfolio and the student's participation in class discussions and peer review sessions.

HS,3070,HS,Native American Law,"Cline, Ken","From first contact through the confrontation surrounding the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Dakota Access Pipeline, Native American law has tried to reconcile two incommensurate legal systems and widely varying government policies.  This course examines the evolution of federal Native American or ""Indian"" Law from colonization onward as impacted by treaties, executive orders, congressional enactments, and major U.S. Supreme Court cases interpreting the U.S. Constitution and statutes as they involve Native American legal issues. This is not a class about tribal law or the indigenous legal systems that exist among the various tribes in the US.  Rather, it examines the legal system imposed on tribes from the outside; a system that has evolved over time and creates the legal framework which tribes operate under today. Students will gain an understanding of law as a policy tool and framework, and acquire the necessary skills to work on policy issues affecting native peoples.  We will focus on primary legal material as well as secondary interpretations of that material.  There will be some comparative law analysis from other countries and an examination of how the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples relates to US practices.  Students will complete several analytical problem sets that require an application of course concepts to fact scenarios as well as a major paper on a legal topic of their choosing.  A class visit to a Maine reservation will allow conversation with tribal leaders involved with current environmental and Native American issues in Maine.

We will be working from a live, nude model to investigate structure, anatomy, and the expressive nature of the human form through a variety of traditional and contemporary approaches. Students will also be trained to look at the figure abstractly through careful consideration of negative space surrounding the figure, siting parallel visual relationships across the body, and by considering lines of gravity as a horizontal and vertical axis for comparative analysis. They will also develop a rudimentary understanding of anatomy (artistically) through skeletal studies and muscle groups while developing both traditional and unconventional ways of seeing and drawing the figure. Students will expand and refine their observational skills, become proficient with a variety of drawing media and understand how these concerns overlap to create representational images. Understanding the integration of formal elements of drawing and how they are combined to achieve a sense of solidity, proportion, gravity, and animation when representing the human figure are our primary concern.

HS,5044,HS,Diaspora and Unbelonging,"van Vliet, Netta","Etymologically, the word ""diaspora"" is traced to the Greek dia meaning through, and speirein, meaning to scatter or to sow. Historically, the term has been associated with narratives of exile, displacement, and migration, and with a sustained relation to what is understood as an originary homeland. Although Jewish diaspora is often the implicit or explicit example through which diaspora is understood, the term has been important for other cultural, ethnic and religious genealogies, as well as for recent efforts to address political questions posed by contemporary configurations of diasporic and displaced populations. In this course, we will use questions about Jewish difference as a point of departure for thinking about questions of diaspora, belonging and unbelonging more generally. Diasporic relations raise questions about what it means to belong to political community, about borders between self and other and between groups, about difference internal and external to the polis, and about the concepts of home, homeland, nation and country. These questions in turn call attention to the relation between different figures and categories central to understandings of home and abroad, stasis and mobility, such as citizen and foreigner, refugee, asylum seeker. This course examines different historical examples of conditions and processes of diaspora by being attentive to conditions and figures of unbelonging. In so doing, we will consider contemporary problems of immigration, displacement, and asylum. We will be particularly attentive to questions about racialization, colonialism, nationalism, gender, sexuality and sexual difference. The course is interdisciplinary, and we will draw on work in postcolonial studies, political theory, literature, anthropology, religion and feminist theory. Students will be evaluated based on attendance, in-class participation, reading responses, and two short analytical essays.

HS,2075,HS,The Anthropology of Food,"Collum, Kourtney","Food is inextricably linked to cultural systems. Indeed, the agricultural anthropologist Robert Rhoades wrote that “few realms of human life touch more components of culture—technological, economic, political, social and religious—than agriculture and its products.” This course uses food as a tool with which to explore human origins, cultural diversity, social structure, and human/environment interactions. Through academic articles and films, the course aims to expose students to the different ways in which anthropologists think about food and how they use different anthropological frameworks to answer questions concerning the human experience. The course will also engage other disciplinary perspectives such as those from history, economics, and political ecology so as to make larger connections between food and society. These perspectives will help foster students’ understanding of the ways in which social, political, and economic processes shape our interactions with food. Designed as a survey course to introduce students to the broad and dynamic subfield of food anthropology, the course is organized around four themes. The first theme—human origins, diets, and biocultural evolution—explores the uniqueness of cooking to the human species, and how the evolution of human diets and culture has shaped different groups’ dietary needs and restrictions. The second theme—globalization and international trade—looks at the flow of foods and food practices around the world, from sugar to sushi. The third theme—hegemony and difference—considers the ways in which race, gender, and class are constructed and expressed through food. The final theme—consumption and embodiment—considers the relationship between eating and the body; readings in this section focus on body image, eating practices, and critical studies of the rhetoric around obesity. Students will be evaluated based on class participation, a recipe analysis, a dietary analysis, and a final class project. The final project will be a shared meal. As a class students will develop a menu including dishes that represent regional food traditions and students’ individual backgrounds. Students will then form small groups and select a dish to prepare. They will work with staff at Blair Dining Hall to prepare their dishes and present their meal.

HS,3073,HS,Bees and Society,"Collum, Kourtney","In the last decade the plight of wild and domesticated bees has pervaded the media and public discourse, yet bees remain largely misunderstood in our society. This course examines the interconnected relationship between humans and bees and asks what bees can teach us about ourselves and our food systems. Through readings, fieldtrips, and guest lectures, students will examine the social, economic, and political dimensions of human-bee interactions, investigating topics such as: historical and contemporary beekeeping practices; the political economy of honey; the role of pollination in agriculture and agroecosystems; domestication and human-animal relationships; biodiversity loss in agricultural systems; pollinator conservation and policy; and cooperation and decision-making in human and bee societies. A truly human-ecological course, Bees & Society integrates the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences to examine the applied problem of protecting pollinators in a time of abrupt environmental change. Students will be evaluated based on: (1) participation in class discussions, fieldwork, and field trips; (2) a series of short reflection papers; and (3) a final class project. For their final project, students will develop two native bee conservation workshops—one for elementary school students and one for farmers and gardeners—and host the workshops at COA’s farms.

This course examines the interconnected relationship between humans and bees and asks what bees can teach us about ourselves and our food systems. Through readings, fieldtrips, and guest lectures, students will examine the social, economic, and political dimensions of human-bee interactions, investigating topics such as: historical and contemporary beekeeping practices; the political economy of honey; the role of pollination in agriculture and agroecosystems; domestication and human-animal relationships; biodiversity loss in agricultural systems; pollinator conservation and policy; and cooperation and decision-making in human and bee societies. A truly human-ecological course, Bees & Society integrates the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences to examine the applied problem of protecting pollinators in a time of abrupt environmental change. Students will be evaluated based on: (1) participation in class discussions, fieldwork, and field trips; (2) a series of short reflection papers; and (3) a final class project. For their final project, students will develop two native bee conservation workshops—one for elementary school students and one for farmers and gardeners—and host the workshops at COA’s farms.

HS,1059,NA,Introduction to the Study of Religion,STAFF,"How do theorists define religion?  What functions does religion serve?  And how do we study religion?  This course is designed to introduce students to the academic study of religion. Rather than focus on a particular religious tradition or set of religious traditions, we will instead engage some of the major theories and methods relevant to the study of religion. The guiding questions of this course are meant to help us explore the reciprocal relationship between theory and method. What we think religion is or how we think it functions (theory) necessarily informs how we study it (method) and vice versa. This course is therefore interdisciplinary and applicable to students working in a broad range of fields. We will engage some of the classic works on religion in psychology, the history of religions, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, and feminism towards broadening and complicating our understandings of the study of religion. We will also pay close attention to the various and shifting constructions of the category of “religion” across disciplines throughout time and interrogate the strengths and weaknesses of theorists’ attempts to explain religion in terms of belief, ritual, behavior, psychology, society, history, gender, etc. Short weekly written assignments encourage students to learn to read and write critically. This course is also largely discussion-based to help students deepen, nuance, and/or complicate their understanding of the readings as well as collectively develop particular themes, ideas or questions that arise in written assignments. Evaluation will be based on weekly written assignments, three take-home essay assignments, and an in-class presentation.

AD,1038,AD,History of Video Art,"Capers, Colin","Today, many use the words 'film' and 'video' interchangeably. In fact, these words refer to different mediums which evolved at different times, in different circumstances, and whose languages and practices originally developed around very different sets of concerns and purposes. In what ways is the distinction still useful in the digital age? This course will critically interrogate the ways humans use moving images to mediate our world, and the repercussions of these uses on individuals, culture, and the contents/subjects of the mediated messages. Many early video artists sought to distinguish the medium from film in that they wanted to create viewers who were active participants rather than passive recipients. In this class we will explore the political and self-expressive impulses in video art, and trace its history from 1965 - the year in which previously established artists Andy Warhol and Nam June Paik first publically exhibited video work - through to the current moment when film is almost extinct and video has become the world's dominant moving image medium. We will look at video art's ties to performance art and activism, and examine how many multi-media artists have situated their use of video in the context of their other practices. Artists whose work and writing about their work will be explored include: Vito Acconci, John Baldessari, Dara Birnbaum, Tony Conrad, Hermine Freed, Joan Jonas, Miranda July, Mariko Mori, Bruce Nauman, Pipilotti Rist, Bill Viola, and William Wegman. We will also examine the role and work of artists' collectives including Ant Farm, Broadside TV, Optic Nerve, and Video Free America. Through secondary sources we will look at the range of historical methodologies and critical theories that have been brought to bear on the works viewed. Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussions and two research papers. Students who come to class with experience working in video will have the opportunity to create their own original work in lieu of one of the two papers.

HS,3074,HS,Mapping the Ocean’s Stories,"Little-Siebold, Todd","This course will examine how members of Maine’s remote coastal and islands communities live in relationship to the ocean. Their connection to the nearby and distant waters is defined by everyday uses such as fishing, lobstering, and wrinkle harvesting as well as deeper historical relationships rooted in many generations of people doing everything from sailing schooners around the world to harvesting shellfish in the same cove over centuries. This class will teach students how to use multi-disciplinary research methodologies to document, map, and analyze both contemporary and historical uses of the ocean. Using coastal and island communities as sites for collaborative community-based research the class will contribute to wider discussions about a process known as Ocean Planning that seeks to create processes to plan how communities, stakeholders, industry and the government build a long term vision of how the spaces of the Gulf of Maine might be used. Students will work in teams to produce a geo-referenced story about a particular place in the ocean off the coast of Maine that has meaning and an emotional connection to a community told in an interesting and compelling way. This information will help give island communities a stronger voice in ocean policy and in decision making processes for siting large scale projects in the nearby ocean environment. The class will draw on methodologies developed around North America to document the everyday uses and interactions people have with the local environment using oral historical and biographical mapping to provide a sort of snapshot of current uses as well as soliciting histories of how those patterns have changed over time. The class will include a substantial fieldwork and field trip component that will require additional times outside of the class schedule. Students will be evaluated on class participation, active engagement in field research settings, short assignments as well as a final project. The class is appropriate for students with a range of backgrounds, however, experience with historical or community-based research or GIS mapping would be helpful.

Each week a different E-STEM professional will engage with students both in the field (where appropriate) and in the classroom to give students a feel for what professionalism and professional work means for different jobs. Some of the local stakeholders will include professionals in fields such as environmental consulting, environmental policy, municipal planning, environmental education, energy and resource management, recreation, research, and conservation. The main objectives of this course are to: increase students’ awareness of and access to a broad group of professionals working in ESTEM fields, provide opportunities for students to read and discuss scientific/technical literature and reports, and to facilitate student understanding of potential pathways to future careers. Beyond meeting and engaging with stakeholders, students will practice re-world work that these professionals engage in such as data management, report preparation, budgeting, communicating science to the public, and dissemination of research findings. They will learn to use software such as excel required in many E-STEM jobs. Students will also practice researching employment opportunities, preparing application material, and interfacing with professionals to inquire about potential or future opportunities. Students will be evaluated based on their performance on weekly assignments, interaction with the weekly stakeholder, and a final project/report.

AD,5029,AD HY,The Range of Sublimity in the Artist Mind,"Clinger, Catherine","Edmund Burke’s chief contribution to aesthetics is his exegesis on the contrary states that define the Beautiful and the Sublime: these are the regular and irregular, binaries of pleasure and pain, appeal and terror, knowingness and not-knowing. Burke encourages the viewer of a ‘place’ to distance herself from the natural agencies that incite emotional response to landscapes. In keeping a distance; however, we risk participating in a lifeless, hegemonic practice that colonizes nature and hinders aesthetic engagement. Proximity to nature (rather than detachment from it) makes visible the consequences of eighteenth-century imperial and nineteenth-century nationalist missions masked in many of the works of the Hudson River School. Non-native forces in the Western Hemisphere took ownership of humans, places, resources, and in the process, devastated whole peoples and ecologies. Through travel, study, research and creative activity, students will learn to see and appraise the transformation of peripatetic practice into art; as well as witness how art can both reveal and conceal the nature of place. How have the varied notions of sublimity affected artist practice over the past 250 years? What are artists making now that counters a narrative that privileges detachment over intimacy and counters modernity’s embrace of indifference? This course will consider the concept of sublimity, both as subject and agent, in the work of visual artists during the aforementioned epochs and the present one. Students will be evaluated on class participation, annotated bibliography, and research paper.  This course requires concurrent registration with AD5030 Artist/Naturalist/Visionary (Foley) and AD5031 Journey into Substance (Clinger/Foley).

HS,2078,W HS,College Seminar: City/Country in U.S. Literature 1860-1920,"Waldron, Karen","This class focuses on U.S. fiction from the realist/naturalist period (roughly 1860-1920), a time when enormous changes were occurring in and on the U.S. landscape. Increasing urbanization, immigration, and industrialization corresponded both with a desire for ‘realistic’ fiction of social problems, and nostalgic stories of a more 'realistic' rural life. For the first time there was a national literature, resulting from the capabilities of large publishing houses, urban centers and mass production — but this national literature was acutely self-conscious of regional differences, and especially of the tension between city and country. Examining works that portray factory towns, urban tenements, midwestern prairies, New England villages, and the broad spectrum of U.S. landscapes of the period, we look at how a complex, turbulent, multi-ethnic, and simultaneously urban and rural American culture defined itself, and thus its gender, class, race, and social relations, and sense of values, against these landscapes. There is a strong emphasis on reading, writing, and discussion. Students will write and revise three critical analyses over the course of the term. Given that the class covers a lot of intellectual and historical ground, students will also do a short fiction project and develop a research paper on their author, landscape, and historical moment. Evaluation will be based on class participation, the writing process for the critical analyses, and the proposal, presentation, and research paper for the short fiction project.

In this class we will examine the physical, cognitive, social, and moral aspects of adolescent growth and development.  Issues to be considered include adolescent relationships (peers, family, romantic), adolescent issues (identity formation, at risk behavior, schooling, and stereotypes), and critical reflection on one's own adolescent experience. The main objectives of this course are to: 1) provide students with a working knowledge of the theories of psychology which pertain to early adolescent development; 2) help students develop the ability to critically analyze information and common assumptions about the development of adolescents; 3) consider contemporary issues and concerns of the field; and 4) to afford students the opportunity to explore their own adolescent development.  Course work entails lecture, discussion, extensive case analysis, and a field component.

Contemporary bioethics is an expansive and fundamentally interdisciplinary field, but this course will consider key dilemmas in bioethics from a philosophical perspective. We will begin by reviewing dominant ethical frameworks, including teleological ethics, deontological ethics, utilitarianism, natural law theory, and virtue ethics. Next, we will discuss specific ethical issues such as, abortion, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, life-sustaining treatments, resource allocation, cloning, biotechnologies, animal research, and informed consent and the doctor-patient relationship. In particular, we will consider how different ethical frameworks shape our assessment of specific ethical dilemmas. My goal in this course is to introduce students to the principles of ethical thinking, to familiarize students with pressing debates in bioethics, and to consider how ethical thinking impacts our response to issues that are politically and socially contentious. Course requirements include class participation, an in-class presentation, a midterm exam, and a final paper.

HS,1063,NA,Public Speaking Workshop,"Rand, Kendra","This class will be conducted as a workshop with an emphasis on students producing increasingly advanced speeches for public performance and/or consumption. We will cover a wide variety of areas including those related to constructing the speech in advance (invention and arrangement), as well as those related to the actual performance of the text (style, memory, and execution). While the primary goal of the class is to create an environment in which students can improve these vital public communication skills, another important goal is to cultivate critical and respectful listening skills (which are themselves vital public communication skills). A wide variety of speaking genres will be covered during the term, though there will be a strong emphasis on public advocacy and persuasion.

This class is designed for students with varying levels of public speaking backgrounds. A diverse array of experiences, skills, and strengths helps foster a collaborative and supportive speaking environment. Throughout the term students will work on individual projects, in pairs, and in larger collaborative groups. There will be a minimal focus on theoretical questions in favor of a ""hands on"" approach to constructing speeches. Students will be evaluated on a number of ""process"" oriented assignments. Final evaluation will be relative to individual participation in the process and not to an objective scale of public speaking talent. As such, students who feel that they are less proficient in the area of public communication should not be worried that this would somehow disadvantage them in terms of grading.

The COA supervisor visits the schools in a liaison capacity, and also evaluates the student teacher's performance a minimum of eight times in the term. Student teachers meet together regularly to discuss such issues as curriculum planning, instruction, best teaching practices, classroom learning environment and broader educational issues. Students may use student teaching to fulfill the COA internship requirement if it is completed prior to graduation.

HS,1064,W HS,College Seminar: Practical Skills in Community Development,"Beard, Ronald","In rural areas throughout the world, citizens, nonprofit leaders, agency staff, and elected officials are coming together to frame complex issues and bring about change in local policy and practice. This course outlines the theory and practice of community development, drawing on the instructor’s experience with the Dùthchas Project for sustainable community development in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, Mount Desert Island Tomorrow, and other examples in the literature. In short, community development allows community members to frame issues, envision a preferred future, and carry out projects that move the community toward that preferred future. By using writing as process—prewriting, writing, and rewriting—to frame and communicate complex public issues, students gain practical skills in listening, designing effective meetings, facilitation, project planning and developimng local policy. Readings, discussions, and guests introduce students to community development theory and practice. Class projects are connected to community issues on Mount Desert Island. By writing and revising short papers, students can reflect on class content, community meetings, newspaper stories, and reading assignments. Evaluation will be based on preparation for and participation in class discussion, several short papers, participation in field work, and contribution to a successful group project. This class meets the first-year writing course requirement.

We will begin with a quick overview of the python programming language, including control statements, input/output, and user-defined functions.  The rest of the course will be structured around a series of case studies designed to teach additional programming skills and illustrate different ways that coding is used in the sciences and social sciences.  These case studies will include: solving systems of ordinary differential equations, stochastic modeling, resampling and bootstrapping, and agent-based models.  If time permits, additional case studies may include: networks, text analysis, and spatial models.  Throughout, program design and general principles for effective scientific coding will be emphasized. 

Students who successfully complete this class will gain an understanding of the basic elements of the python programming language as well as scipy and numpy, two packages whose use is ubiquitous in scientific computing.  Students will learn how to develop, implement, and test code for a variety of applications across the natural, physical, and social sciences.

HS,5047,HS,Global Disorder and the Future of Foreign Policy,"McKown, Jamie","This is a reading intensive course that is tied to the annual “Camden Conference” held in Camden, Maine. This three day conference brings in experts from all over the world to discuss a range of topics related to foreign policy, international relations, and diplomacy. Over the past several years, College of the Atlantic has developed a relationship with the conference that enables our students to engage the various events over the full three days. Every year highlights a particular theme, with a new set of focused panel discussions, speakers, and readings. The theme of the 2018 conference is “New World Disorder and America’s Future.” The central focus of the conference will be what role the United States will play in the future development of international security and the global political order. Special emphasis will be placed on the interrelations between the United States, China, and Europe. Topics will include the impact of globalization, the rise of nationalism, transformations in global economies, and the management of a range of future threats such as climate change, population growth, and cyber insecurity. This class is built to parallel the thematic cornerstones of this year’s Camden topic. It is modeled as a reading intensive and discussion based seminar that will include works from both the conference reading list as well as supplemental works. The goals of the class are twofold. First, to prepare students to attend and play an active role in the conference (attendance is a requirement of the class) by providing them a background immersion in the topics that are at the center of this year’s conference. Second, to assist students returning from the conference in critically integrating those experiences with the course materials and their own particular research interests. Class discussion will be jointly led by students and faculty. Evaluation will be based on a series of short written assignments, attendance and active participation in class discussion, attendance at the conference, and a final written analysis of a particular topic related to the conference theme. Students interested in international relations, global politics, diplomacy, foreign policy, or economic development/trade policies are especially encouraged to enroll. Prior classes in foreign policy or international relations are not required. Students who have taken a previous Camden Conference course can also receive credit for this course and are encouraged to consider enrolling.

MD,3012,NA,The Anthropocene,"Hall, Sarah","This course considers the definition of the human in terms of the politics of climate change and discussions about the notion of the Anthropocene, by staging an encounter between the discipline of geology and work in the humanities. Suggestions by scientists over the last few decades that human activity on the planet has attained geological force led Nobel Laureate Paul Crutzen to argue in 2000 that the current epoch should be called the ""Anthropocene."" Others challenge this suggestion, pointing out that humans have long left traces on the earth. Discussions about the Anthropocene are tied to the challenge of how to respond to the effects of human-induced climate change, including the threat of human extinction. This course will address questions such as: How do scientists and humanists engage with policy and scholarship about climate change? What are their central questions and key terms? We will consider how understandings of geological time and the stories rocks tell, might inform thinking in the humanities about climate change. In turn, we will consider how humanist questions about the definition of the human might inform the ways in which science interfaces with politics and policy regarding climate change. 

This course is co-taught by a geologist and an anthropologist, and will be an exercise in translation between very different fields. Class material will include laboratory activities, seminar discussions, and close readings of texts in postcolonial studies, geology, anthropology, and literature. Students will be assessed based on class participation, reading responses, laboratory activities, and a final project.

We will consider how understandings of geological time and the stories rocks tell, might inform thinking in the humanities about climate change. In turn, we will consider how humanist questions about the definition of the human might inform the ways in which science interfaces with politics and policy regarding climate change. 

This course is co-taught by a geologist and an anthropologist, and will be an exercise in translation between very different fields. Class material will include laboratory activities, seminar discussions, and close readings of texts in postcolonial studies, geology, anthropology, and literature. Students will be assessed based on class participation, reading responses, laboratory activities, and a final project.

HS,2081,HS,Postcolonialism and Psychoanalysis,"van Vliet, Netta","The course considers the definition of the human by bringing together the field of postcolonial studies with the field of psychoanalysis. Both postcolonial studies and psychoanalysis engage questions of sexualized and racialized difference in the context of 20th century Europe and the legacies of colonialism. Postcolonial studies and psychoanalysis both also contend with notions of individual and collective well-being, with belonging and exclusion. 

Psychoanalysis is a colonial discipline which produced a form of analysis that emerged in the time of colonialism. As such, psychoanalysis contributed to colonial notions of civilized and primitive, of man and woman, of normal and abnormal, of Europe and its others. At the same time, however, contexts of anticolonial struggle in turn shaped psychoanalytic thought. By examining texts central to these two fields, this course considers how psychoanalytic thought can help us understand the processes through which individuated subjects become defined in terms of collective groups of belonging such as the nation, and how filiation and family is connected to affiliation and nation, through relations of affect and concepts of representational politics.

We will begin with an introduction to the inception of psychoanalysis in Europe, and examine how it travels and is taken up in Europe’s colonies. Drawing on postcolonial theory and literature, we will learn about the historical emergence of the term “postcolonial,” the political and disciplinary debates to which the term gave rise, and its relation to ideas of nationalism, diaspora, Orientalism. Geographically, we will examine examples of anticolonial struggle in Algeria, India, and Palestine/Israel. Readings will focus on texts by Sigmund Freud, Jacques Derrida, the Subaltern Studies group, and scholars who directly engage with these thinkers, including Jacques Lacan, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, and Gayatri Spivak. Students will be evaluated based on class participation, reading responses, a mid-term essay and final paper.

HS,5048,HS,Wittgenstein and Heidegger: Return to the Ordinary,"Visvader, John","For over 2,500 years philosophers and students of nature have sought to find a basic understanding of the nature of reality of both the human and the natural worlds. This quest has led to theories of reality that stand behind and above the ordinary realm of experience. This search, and the many assumptions that have guided it have formed the basis of contemporary philosophy and the sciences. Both Wittgenstein and Heidegger have deeply questioned these assumptions and have tried, in a sense to return to the richness of ordinary experience – Wittgenstein in exploring the realm of the language we speak in describing the ordinary, and Heidegger in attempting to remind us of the simplicity of our direct experience. This class offers an exploration of the ideas of these two radical thinkers and their impact on contemporary thought. Assignments will include a series of short papers doing exegesis and/or comparative analysis and a longer final paper. There will be some reading assigned for the winter break, prior to the start of class, including Descartes' Meditations.

During the middle and late part of the 19th century, there were many competing processes for producing a monochromatic image. We now tend to group these historical processes into a general category of so-called ""Alternative Processes"" which include the Cyanotype, Van Dyke Brown, Albumen, Salted Paper Print, Gum Bichromate, Kallitype and many, many others.

This hands on, lab based class will offer students the opportunity to work in at least five different historical processes. We'll explore some of the methodologies in common usage during the 19th century that are still viable today. We'll also learn to make purposed, custom digital negatives to print from and students are encouraged to arrive with some preexisting images that they’re interested in working with. Basic computer skills and a general understanding of photography are expected. Some reading will be required. Students will be evaluated on their willingness to experiment with image making techniques, individual progress over the term, class participation during critiques and the successful completion of a representative body of work including a digital portfolio of finished pieces.

HS,3079,W HS,College Seminar: The Anthropology of Food,"Collum, Kourtney","This course uses food as a lens to explore human origins, cultural diversity, social structure, and human/environment interactions. Through academic articles and films, the course exposes students to the different ways anthropologists think about food and the frameworks they use to answer questions concerning the human experience. The course also engages other disciplinary perspectives—including history, economics, and political ecology—to make larger connections between food and society.

Designed as a survey course, this course introduces students not only to writing as process—prewriting, writing, and rewriting—but also to the broad and dynamic subfield of food anthropology. The course is organized around four themes. The first—human origins, diets, and biocultural evolution—explores the uniqueness of cooking to the human species, and how the co-evolution of human diets and culture has shaped different groups' dietary needs, practices, and restrictions. The second—globalization and international trade—looks at the flow of foods and food practices around the world, from sugar to sushi. The third—hegemony and difference—considers how race, gender, and class are constructed and expressed through food. The final theme—consumption and embodiment—considers the relationship between eating and the body; readings in this section focus on body image, eating practices, and critical studies of the rhetoric around hunger and obesity. Students are evaluated based on class participation, a series of reflection papers, a dietary analysis, and a recipe project involving a prepared meal, an audio-visual presentation, and a critical analysis paper.

Using the province of Asturias as a base of operations this class will examine the deep history of agriculture in the region and its ancient traditions of cider-making and cheese production. The rugged mountains of the Cantabrian coast are home to thousands of small, diversified granjas, or farms, that have experienced massive changes in the current farmers’ lifetimes. 

Students will travel to Asturias in northern Spain during winter break to learn about the changes in social, cultural and economic aspects of farming in the region from Roman times to the present with an emphasis on the evolution of rural farms and landscapes. We will discuss land tenure, land use, labor practices, farming practices, and much more at sites throughout Asturias as we think through what historical insights can tell us about the past, present and future of farming and the rural economy. Students will do exercises on landscape history, visit museums, farms, cider producers and research stations as well as meeting leading experts. The course will continue with a seminar during the winter term on campus in which students will pursue projects inspired by their experiences and learning in Spain. Student evaluation will be based on the participation in the field-based components of the class and the project-based learning back on campus.

HS,4058,HS,Personal Finance and Impact Investing,"Friedlander, Jay","Financial decisions are often a reflection of personal beliefs encompassing lifestyle, ethics, personal worth, security and numerous other factors. Personal Finance and Impact Investing merges an exploration of personal financial choices with a broader exploration and introduction to impact investing. To ground the discussion, students will forecast and analyze their present and future financial needs, investigating various scenarios. Then the class will examine investing fundamentals and explore the emerging field of impact investing.

Impact investors use a multitude of investing strategies and mechanisms to simultaneously seek social, environmental and financial returns. They create avenues for private investment to work alongside non-governmental organizations, large corporations, small businesses and others to help solve global and local problems. Impact investments have funded solutions in diverse arenas including food systems, climate change, poverty, affordable housing, clean technology and public health.

Through readings, discussions and class projects students will explore the benefits and pitfalls of different strategies and the potential of investments to create social and environmental change. During the course students will learn how to create financial projections and evaluate the financial returns of enterprises. For their final project, students will have to recommend an investment platform that generates returns financially, socially and/or environmentally.  Students will be evaluated based on class participation, written assignments and verbal presentations.

MD,5012,NA,"Politics, Body, Representation","Baker, Jodi","Drawing on performance studies, movement training, postcolonial studies and feminist theory, this class will investigate understandings of what is made to count as ""political"" in relation to claims about representation and the body. Over the course of the term, we will investigate and produce a range of conditions through which we consider ideas about responsibility, decision, the unknown and unexpected, repetition and difference, translation and dialogue, and relations of individual to group. We will do so through learning about the ways in which bodies matter in the fields of theatre, anthropology and literature. Both anthropology and theatre are often presumed to be vehicles for representation and for political change, but they have also posed questions about how the body challenges assumptions about representation and politics. This course will grapple with assumptions that politics is primarily about representation, speaking in ""one’s own name,"" or in the name of others. We will take questions about representation and its limits as a point of departure to consider the significance of the body (and bodies) for understandings of politics. We will focus on questions of affect, the sensory, proximity, temporality, scale and place. In so doing, we will consider the idea of politics as based on a relation and response to an other, rather than on representation. In turn, we will address questions about the relationship between art and politics. Classes will include movement training practices and seminar discussion. Course materials may include works by Hannah Arendt, Anne Bogart, Charlie Chaplin, Charles Darwin, Jacques Derrida, Sarah DeLappe, Cornelius Eady, Shoshana Felman, Sigmund Freud, Brandon Jacobs-Jenkins, Valeria Luiselli, Jean-Luc Nancy, William Shakespeare, Sophocles, Tadashi Suzuki and Anna Tsing.

Young adult literature is one of the strongest areas of publishing in America currently. For example in 2014 The Fault in Our Stars was the best selling print and ebook work in America. Exposure to young adult literature will allow pre-service teachers to have an overview of current titles that can be used in or out of class, while students not interested in teaching will have opportunities to stretch their reading and writing canon. Assignments will include reading both academic and trade books as well as articles. Students will learn through a variety of methods from class discussion to preparing class lectures. They will be in touch with professional young adult writers, and they will also have choice in a term-long project that will be done throughout the trimester. Evaluation is on a continual basis as the course is structured to allow students to demonstrate growth over the course of the trimester.

ES,1062,ES,Introduction to Botany,"Letcher, Susan","Green plants power the Earth’s ecosystem and make possible the existence of life as we know it. Because they lack obvious movement, it is easy to dismiss plants as passive beings without behavior or intelligence. Yet plants integrate environmental signals and respond in subtle, remarkable ways that increase their Darwinian fitness. Understanding plant behavior and plant intelligence requires a shift of perspective into the world of plants. This class explores their evolutionary origins, metabolism and physiology, anatomy and morphology, life cycles, and their modern-day diversity. The last third of the class focuses on the ecological roles of plants and their relationships with other organisms in their environment. Designed for students with no science background beyond high school biology, this course offers an overview of important topics in the study of plants and a window into their fascinating lives. Through lab work and field trips, we will explore the diversity of plants and the structures and adaptations that allow them to thrive in an enormous range of environments. Students will be evaluated based on quizzes and take-home exams, a brief in-class presentation, and a field/lab notebook.

We will critically examine a series of prominent models for understanding different ways in which artificial intelligence works and is currently transforming our political economy and culture. We will critically examine and experiment with employing some key methods in futures studies to look at possible futures, assess their attractiveness and probability, and consider what steps might be taken to promote or prevent them. Methods considered will include, for instance: variations of extrapolation techniques, futures markets, scenario building, the Delphi process of consensus and futures imaging. A weekend workshop on futures imaging will be included as part of the course. Texts will include Yuval Harari’s ""Homo Deus"", Nick Bostrom’s ""Superintelligence"", and a wide variety of short essays and website materials.  Assignments will include short homework exercises, two problem sets, and a series of short papers building to a final project on a topic of the student’s interest. Topics could include, for example, the impact of drones and cyber warfare on the national security state system, the role of automated and/or distance learning in transforming education, the use of AI to monitor and manipulate environmental systems or transformations of health care or food systems in light of AI when combined with nanotechnology, genetic modification or big data. Student work will be evaluated on the extent to which it demonstrates the development of skills for critically understanding, assessing and appropriately using the theories and methods covered in the course both in written projects as individuals and in collaborative discussions and workshop activities.

HS,1065,HS,Philosophies of Good and Evil,"Lakey, Heather","Good and evil are timeless topics and they have motivated centuries of philosophical thinking. Although the terms ""good"" and ""evil"" are commonly used across a range of discourses, they are ambiguous, equivocal, and contested concepts. In an effort to clarify our ideas about good and evil, this course provides a broad overview of the issues, arguments, and debates that shape philosophical ethics. Guiding questions include the following: What are the origins of good and evil? What makes an action right or wrong? Why do we act morally? What should we do with someone who commits a horrific act? Who decides what counts as a horrific act? Is evil an outdated or relevant concept? Do the concepts of good and evil help or hinder moral thinking? 
	
To critically explore the concepts of rightness, wrongness, goodness, and badness, we will move between fiction and philosophical treatises. We will read works by key thinkers including St Augustine, Niccolo Machiavelli, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hannah Arendt, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Flannery O'Connor, James Baldwin, William Golding, Sherman Alexie, Rosalind Hursthouse, and Cornel West. Along the way, we will study deontology, utilitarianism, natural law ethics, virtue ethics, ethical relativism, feminist ethics, existentialism, and nihilism. In addition, we will unpack the ethical arguments that orbit concrete topics such as execution, murder, abortion, moral character, racial injustice, pornography, prostitution, duties to animals, and our duties to one another.

HS,1066,W,Tutorial: Writing Structures,"Kozak, Anne","This tutorial examines not only the structural parts of writing—the sentence, paragraph, and whole text—but also how these contribute to writing effective expository, analytical, and argumentative essays. Using short news stories or op ed pieces, students examine how the individual parts of the sentence and the sentences within a paragraph convey the writer’s message to the intended audience.

HS,1067,NA,Religion and Science,"Brodeur, Emma","There is a common assumption that religion and science are, and have been historically, in fierce conflict with one another. Popular science, the media, and to a certain extent, the history of science, have contributed to the view that religion and science represent antithetical domains of knowledge about or approaches to the world. This course explores an array of issues, thinkers, and approaches in order to better understand the complexity of the interactions between religion and science, primarily in the modern Euro-American context but also with reference to non-Christian sources. Rather than approach religion and science from the standpoint of theological questions, this course will instead pay close attention to the dynamic histories of the meanings of the concepts religion and science themselves. Topics covered include early modern cartography and anatomy, the challenge of Darwinian evolution, and contemporary cognitive theories of religion. Short weekly written assignments help students learn to read and write critically. The course is also discussion-based with a final research paper of the student’s choice.

HS,1069,W HS,Ethnographic Writing,"van Vliet, Netta","Ethnographic writing, literally the “writing of a people,” is anthropology’s primary disciplinary mode of representation, based on participant-observation fieldwork. Early ethnographies were usually written by European and American anthropologists about people they had studied in far away places. In the 1970s and on, critical questions about representation began to challenge assumptions about ethnographic work, raising questions about objectivity, transparency, and the relationship of the ethnographer to the people and place about which he or she is writing. This class will introduce students to a range of ethnographies in the discipline of anthropology, as well as to the political, cultural, and intellectual contexts in which these ethnographies were produced. At the same time, we will consider epistemological, ethical, philosophical and methodological issues that such writing involves, including questions about representation and interpretation. In addition to classic ethnographies, we will also read some fiction, travel writing, and journalism. We will consider questions about how ethnographic knowledge is authorized, how assumptions about interpretation shape ethnographic writing, and the relationship between author and reader. Students will be asked to experiment with ethnographic writing themselves, through a series of short writing assignments as well as a final project. The course is designed to allow students to workshop their own writing. Students will be evaluated on the development and improvement of their own writing over the course of the term, as well as on their ability to critically evaluate and closely read ethnographies as texts, and on their engagement with their peers’ writing, considering elements such as authorial voice, the nature of characterization, and the overall movement of a text.

Through reading the work of Maggie Nelson, Claudia Rankine and C.D. Wright, we will be able to think about current trends and aesthetics in American literature, and also about key topics in our political landscape. Each of these three writers have developed a signature style but also share much in common, and we will use their work to think about what it means to take a queer approach to genre, how we might write about identity and power at the beginning of the 21st century, and what fusing new forms can do for our own art-making. We will read volumes of work by each writers—possibly including Jane: A Murder, Bluets and The Argonauts by Nelson; Don’t Let Me Be Lonely and Citizen by Rankine; and Deepstep Come Shining, One Big Self, and One with Others by Wright—and respond to them in both critical and creative ways.

The course begins by examining a relatively unknown yet rather extraordinary novel from 1967:  Sawako Ariyoshi's The Doctor's Wife.  After Ariyoshi, we will read from quite varied authors published within the last forty years:  Buchi Emecheta, Clarice Lispector, Nawal El Saadawi, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Hanan al-Shaykh, Jeannette Winterson, Rose Tremain, Nora Okja Keller, Fadia Faqir, and Yvonne Vera. We will also read some classic and contemporary feminist literary theory to gain a sense of how feminist scholars approach women's novels and our questions.

We will examine a series of contemporary controversies by examining their history, the stakeholders involved, and the pros and cons of the relevant alternative reform measures that have been proposed. Topics covered in a given term will vary based on changing external factors such as the timing of elections as well as student interests. Likely areas that may be covered include: campaign finance reform, gerrymandering, instant runoff voting, election technologies, voter suppression, alternative governmental models, the electoral college, party primaries, campaign communication regulation, government funding of elections, nationalization of election standards, etc..  While the emphasis of the class will be on the US context, we will often draw on international case studies as comparative reference points to assist in evaluating possible policy alternatives. The course will follow a collaborative laboratory model with students dividing into teams to research and present briefings throughout the term.  In addition to this workshop emphasis there will be a common weekly discussion of a salient election related topic or theme. Students will be evaluated based on their participation in and engagement with the solutions workshop, the various presentations and written reports produced by their team, short form individual response papers related  to the common discussion topics, and required meetings with the instructor. The course is open to students of all interests, and familiarity with the US political system is not a prerequisite. Students should see this course as a good starting point to both familiarize themselves with various aspects of American politics while also providing them the opportunity to work on crafting a focused policy proposal that responds to a contemporary political controversy.

MD,1016,NA,Seeing Tropical Ecology through Arts Practice,"Rock, Jennifer","This course is an experiment in seeing ecology through arts practice, with a focus on the tropical rainforest of Costa Rica. It is part of a three-credit expeditionary program in neotropical field ecology and conservation. We will examine how an arts approach (observation, rendering, questioning, hypothesising) leads to reflective practice on ecological process and interaction; how observing pattern can lead us to questioning and understanding process; and how sensory immersion and visualising connectivity lets us see complex interactions. 

The course content will interact daily with two other courses as part of a three-credit expeditionary program in Neotropical field ecology and conservation. Creative descriptions of the vastly different habitats at divergent field sites will feed into discussions of natural history, ecology and biology, with daily questions for science discussions drawn from arts-facilitated observation.

Evaluation will be based on three components: (1) student interaction with assigned readings and discussion of them (both written and oral); (2) an artist's notebook (combined sketchbook and journal) which will serve to document a student's process of inquiry including observation and description of place (at both micro and macro level) and daily ""questions for science"" derived from arts-based inquiry. As a reflective journal, it will also critically examine one's expectations, intentions, and observations of process and outcome. (3) A final project that will consolidate/montage a particular vein of observation and questioning from the student's observation of interactions of place (e.g. an aspect of ecology, environmental physiology or human ecology). The final project will be designed to be sharable with an outside audience. No arts experience or skill is necessary. In addition to sketching, other creative methods of observation will be used such as rubbings, and various simple printmaking techniques such as monoprint, and both relief and gelatine plates, as well as words (e.g. poetry) and found materials (that are acceptable for re-entry through US customs!).

It is part of a three-credit expeditionary program in neotropical field ecology and conservation. Students will spend considerable time in the field learning the biotic diversity of each region through observation and application of field techniques. Students will then integrate these field experiences with readings from the primary literature and classic works to contemplate and discuss current topics in tropical ecology. Primary emphasis will be placed on the vertebrate fauna of Costa Rica but every attempt will be made to also include invertebrates and plants by enlisting the expertise of local naturalists. The course will visit Caribbean slope rainforest, pre-montane forest, montane cloud forest, Pacific slope dry forest, Pacific wet forest, and Pacific beach/marine communities. Non-travel days will typically consist of early to late-morning field time, afternoon lectures or discussions followed by early evening to late night field time. Evaluation will be based on a detailed field journal, performance on a series of field-based exercises that focus on knowledge of species and concepts, level of engagement in class discussions, and quality of work associated with an independent research project.

HS,1072,HS,Political Communication,"McKown, Jamie","This class will provide a broad introductory overview of the history, practice, and core concepts that encompass political communication  through an empirical examination of grounded applications of such strategies primarily in electoral contexts. In order to capitalize on the salience of the Fall election cycle, the course materials will be based on a series of studies directly tied to electoral campaigns in the United States. Instead of studying various theories of political persuasion in the abstract, we will extract principles that commonly appear in political messaging from both contemporary and historical examples. In addition, we will examine current controversies in the field of political communication related to both ethical and legal considerations. Beyond their engagement with class sessions, students will participate in two collaborative projects. The first will involve tracking political persuasion techniques in campaigns that are occurring in real time during the term. The second will involve students working in teams to produce their own political messaging materials for a hypothetical campaign. The overall goals of the course are three-fold. First, to provide a broad survey of the history of political campaign communication and advertising as it has developed in the United States. Second, to confront some of the pragmatic issues that go into producing messaging strategies for electoral candidates. Third, to help students cultivate a more critical approach to analyzing the political messages that they confront in their daily lives. The class will be highly interactive with discussion being the primary mode of instruction. However, there will also lecture components that provide the historical basis for the case studies we are examining. Final evaluation will based on a combination of class participation, several take home essay assignments, the contemporary tracking assignment, and a final creative project in which student produce their own campaign materials. The class is open to all students, regardless of their experience in politics or their knowledge of American history. It is well suited for introductory students who are interested in politics, human persuasion, and mass communication. However, it is also equally valuable for advanced students seeking to deepen their understanding of political persuasion.

HS,3081,NA,"Jewish Bodies: Race, Gender and Sexuality","Brodeur, Emma","What does it mean to have or be a body?  What makes a body ""Jewish""?  And what do bodies teach us about Judaism?  Many people associate Judaism with belief in God and refer to Jews as the “People of the Book.” But spiritual pursuits such as belief and study are not the only markers of Jewish identity. Alongside and sometimes against these images of Jews and Judaism, the modern period produces an intense interest in Jewish bodies—physical, symbolic, and imagined—that contributes to what Judaism is and has been. In this course, we will explore how Jewish bodies, including the bodies of individuals, the body of God, and the body of the Nation, are imagined, constructed, and managed within and without Judaism in modern Europe, Israel, and the United States. We will also explore how our understandings of Judaism might change when we investigate representations of Jewish bodies with attention to race, gender, and sexuality. Although this course focuses on Jewish thought and culture, it is intended for any student interested in the relationship between embodiment and religion and culture in the modern period. This course is also intended as seminar primarily based on classroom discussion and participation. Although the main assignments are essay questions on assigned readings, students are encouraged to utilize alternative media applicable to their respective disciplines and to think creatively not only about the construction of bodies within texts but also the ways in which ""actual"" and ""imagined"" bodies inform texts. Evaluation is based on participation, short weekly assignments, and a final paper or project.

HS,3082,HS,Global Ethics: Moral/Spiritual Approaches to Climate Change,"Cox, Gray","Are there fundamental principles of ethics on which the diverse spiritual and cultural traditions from around the world can agree? Is ethics about principles used to make decisions or is it, alternatively, more fundamentally a matter of how processes and relationships are developed and pursued? What are the relationships between spiritual traditions and moral practices – does one ground or frame the other? Are there any kinds of objective truths in morality or spirituality that might guide collaborative research into major global challenges we face? This course will examine these issues in the context of the case of climate change. It will look at common and divergent ways in which climate change issues get framed from the points of view of major philosophical and religious points of view including the Abrahamic Faiths and their variants (e. g. Judaism, Catholicism, Quakerism), Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Indigenous religions, Utilitarianism, Kantianism, and Virtue based ethics. A major part of the class will involve participation in activities of dialogue and sharing in person as well as on line with people of different ethical and faith traditions. 

The goals for the course are to: 1. develop students’ understanding of the key framing ideas, practices and cultural contexts of the major religious and ethical traditions around the globe; 2. develop students’ skills in critical participatory research and dialogue to pursue common ground, reconciliation and collaboration in interfaith and cross-cultural projects; and 3. advance these understandings and skills in the specific context of work on climate change around the globe. Class format will include lecture and discussion on classic texts in the traditions and interpretations of them dealing with climate issues. The course will also include weekly lab sessions which will include both local and online dialogues and sharing with representatives of different ethical and faith traditions. Assignments will include daily homework assignments for engaging with texts and reflecting on experiences, experiments with activities associated with differing spiritual traditions, two problem sets dealing with the different ideas and skills covered in the course and a term long project exploring the climate change views of one ethical or faith tradition in depth.  With regard to level of instruction, this will be a course that is appropriate for students with varying levels of background in the subject matters covered. Students who have strong backgrounds in philosophy, studies of different cultures and methods of dialogue and conflict resolution will find much to challenge and interest them in it but first year students with little background -- who are motivated and interested -- should find that they can get a great deal out of the course. They will each be evaluated based on progress made in reaching the three goals of the class relative to the level they start at.

HS,3083,HS,Feminist Theory in a Transnational Frame II,"van Vliet, Netta","This course covers some of the central texts and genealogies of feminist thought, with a focus on transnational feminist theory. We will address periods of feminist thought that have been significant in shaping the concerns of transnational feminisms, including 1970s U.S. feminism, French feminism, postcolonial theory, and Marxist thought. Through seminar discussion about a variety of texts and films, we will consider how differences across national borders have informed discussions about transnational feminist solidarity. We will examine how feminist theory can help us think about the following: kinship; reproduction; the law and justice; human rights discourse, political economy, racialized and other forms of difference; existence and the subject; the relation between individual and group; the relation between terms such as ""gender"" and ""sex;"" and the varied currencies the terms ""queer"" and ""feminist"" have carried in different national and transnational contexts. This course builds on Feminist Theory in a Transnational Frame, and while prior coursework in feminist and sexuality studies is beneficial, it is not necessary. Ideally, students in the course will have varied degrees of familiarity with the central questions of the course. This should allow for substantive discussion and opportunities to both formulate and respond to questions posed by class material. This class builds on work done in other courses that address questions of feminist thought, but also is intended to include students with a range of backgrounds. Students will be evaluated based on class participation, weekly reading responses, a mid-term and a final essay.

The focus of this course is on the economic imperatives of capitalism, the resulting institutional arrangements, and the socioeconomic outcomes that capitalism produces; we will also dedicate some time to the (other) cultural dimensions of capitalism, largely through the incorporation of guest lecturers in the latter part of the term. The foundational economic analysis will use both Marxist and what can be called “critical macroeconomic” theories to understand the economic processes and results of capitalism. Our focus will be on contemporary capitalism, but we will briefly examine the historical development of capitalism as a means of understanding contemporary patterns. A major impetus for the course is Thomas Piketty’s ""Capitalism in the 21st Century"", and its focus on inequality will be a major focus of the course. Other prominent themes will be pre-capitalist modes of production, the labor theory of value, markets and processes of labor commodification and alienation, the formal and informal institutions of capitalism, money and other forms of debt, international capitalistic relations, crises, and variations of contemporary capitalism. Learning will be accomplished via the reading, study, analysis, and discussion of classic and contemporary theories of capitalism, and applications to current local, national, and international situations and events. Evaluation will be based on four major problem sets (consisting of short essay responses), a final poster presentation, and participation in classroom discussions and other fora.

This course embraces both definitions as it delves into case studies of food enterprises across Maine’s agri-food value chain. Two central questions frame the course: 1) What does it take to sustain Maine’s food system? 2) How do food systems entrepreneurs pursuing their passion sustain themselves? Through academic articles, guest lectures, case studies, and field experiences, students will learn about the physical, political, economic, and social infrastructure that supports Maine’s food system. In addition, they’ll learn about the benefits and challenges faced by those dedicating their lives to food systems ventures.

It is part of a three-credit expeditionary program focused on the life and work of Federico García Lorca and its unique relevance in the face of today's cultural and political landscape. This course will focus primarily on Lorca’s ideas about creative process and audience dynamic as articulated in interviews, writings and most especially his 1933 lecture “Juego y Teoría del Duende” in which he defines the core of his work as sensual and irrational “a struggle not a thought” and “a sort of corkscrew that can get art into the sensibility of an audience.” Assigned readings will include Lorca’s rural trilogy (Yerma, Blood Wedding and The House of Bernarda Alba) as well as some of his lesser known plays, especially The Public/The Audience and also his work in film and opera. In connection, students will learn about his tenure as artistic director of the rural touring company La Barraca (The Shack) and his personal/professional/collaborative relationships with other artists of the time. Through a sequence of practical reading, building and performance projects, plus 3 weeks of field study in the rural and urban areas of Spain, students will gain a deeper understanding of the people, places and circumstances that influenced Lorca’s plays, the profound effect his work had on theatre in the twentieth century and how it continues to influence art and performance today. Students will be evaluated on successful completion of all short projects and assignments, quality of work produced and effective contribution to the group discussion and dynamic.

It is part of a three-credit expeditionary program focused on the life and work of Federico García Lorca and its unique relevance in the face of today's cultural and political landscape. García Lorca moved from a regional poet to a world poet in the span of ten years: 1926-1936. At the heart of García Lorca’s work was the physical and cultural geography of Andalucia; in order to understand his work one must understand the mix of artistic and literary traditions in his hometown of Granada. Students will study the collected poetry of García Lorca (in translation) and discuss major themes in García Lorca’s writing: death, music, deserts, rivers, suffering, love, and sexuality. 

We will also discuss how García Lorca became a poet of the world after his travels to Latin America and the U.S. and how that changed his writing style to reflect broader themes. García Lorca was amazed by the size and scope of NYC, saying, “the two elements the traveler first captures in the big city are extra human architecture and furious rhythm. Geometry and anguish.” After 1930, García Lorca’s work becomes orientated toward that “geometry and anguish.” One of the movements García Lorca developed and perfected in his poetry was surrealist writing, but this surrealism was from a distinctly Spanish point of view. As a young artist, Lorca studied in Madrid at the Residencia de estudiantes along with artist and writers: Salvador Dalí, Damaso Alonso, Jorge Guillén, and Vincente Aleixandre, among others. This group of writers and artists would become known as “The Generation of ‘27” and Lorca’s poetic life would not be complete without considering their work too. The class will introduce students to García Lorca’s poetry through close reading, translation, theory, and research into the times and places of its composition. We will trace the development of García Lorca and other artists (poets, graphic artists, musicians) as they use what weapons they had to confront Franco’s fascist forces in 1936. Students will be evaluated on weekly written responses, a sequence of short essays and creative writing projects, effective preparation and participation.

It is part of a three-credit expeditionary program focused on the life and work of Federico García Lorca and its unique relevance in the face of today's cultural and political landscape. Rooted in a deep study of early twentieth century Spanish history, art and politics, our discussion and research will also lean heavily toward contemporary connections - how Lorca’s peculiar moment in history helped shape our own. Students will look broadly at the Spanish timeline focusing primarily on the period known as the Second Spanish Republic (1931-1939). They will also investigate the uniquely complex religious and cultural history of Andalucia, study the Arabic poetry of al-Andalus, learn about the Caliphates of Córdoba and Granada, and discuss how that particular landscape influenced Lorca’s work, politics and personal life. Through personal research, readings, video, guest speakers and targeted field work throughout Spain (Madrid, Granada, Belchite, Jarama, Valle de los Caidos, Visnar, Almería) students will explore a wide gamut of Lorca’s life experience as well as the continuing debate about the motives and details of his execution by Fascist forces in 1936. Students will also study the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, Francoism, and the “pact of silence” that was put in place as Spain transitioned to a democracy in 1976. Readings will include Ian Gibson, George Orwell, Javier Cercas, Helen Graham, Maria M. Delgado, Francisco Ferrándiz, Jaume Peris Blanes and others. Evaluation in this course will be based on the successful completion of all short assignments as well as effective drafting, documentation and presentation of a major final research project (the medium, scope and structure of this project will be determined by the student in consult with both instructors).

MD,1017,NA,Culture and Ecology of Taiwan,"Morse, Suzanne","Taiwan is what one historian calls a ""forbidden nation."" Recognized as an independent state by a small fraction of the world's countries, it has developed into a fervently multilingual and multiethnic democracy in spite of centuries of colonization by the Dutch, Chinese, and Japanese, and nearly a half century under martial law following the second World War. On an island that one geologist speculates may represent the most interesting geology in the world bisected by the Tropic of Cancer and formed by the Philippine sea plate subducting under and over the Eurasian continental plate, its ecology is rich in bio- and cultural diversity. This 2-credit course is part of a three-credit expeditionary program to Taiwan, and aims for students to gain theoretical lenses and ethnographic tools with which to better understand the historical forces that shape Taiwan's human ecology. Students will also gain critical media literacy skills and an understanding of the ways in which history, geography, language, religion, and international relations impact sociopolitical realities in this case study that provides both window and mirror into colonial legacies and their influence on current demographic, social, cultural, economic, and political relationships. Students will also consider what a feminist lens contributes to understanding these past and current relationships. Learning experiences include field trips to farms, markets, a women's cooperative, museums, schools, universities, and a hike up a sacred mountain, as well as invited guests who can speak to local agroecology and cultural anthropology. Students will be evaluated on their understanding and skills demonstrated in a street mapping and participant-observation exercise, critical media compare and contrast, a self-designed final project and lexicon, and weekly individual meetings or written reflections.

ES,3083,ES QR,Linear Algebra with Applications to Differential Equations,"Feldman, David","The first half of this class will consist of a rapid tour of the key elements of linear algebra. We will cover vector and matrix algebra, linear vector spaces and subspaces, basis and dimension, the determinant, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We will then consider first-order linear differential equations---first scalar equations and then systems of equations. We will see that linear algebra is an indispensable tool for solving systems of linear differential equations and understanding the geometric structure of their solutions. In addition to covering basic theory, we will consider a handful of case studies that illustrate the power of the mathematical techniques we are learning. These case studies will be drawn from across the sciences. The particular case studies we examine will depend on student interests.

Students who successfully complete this course will gain a solid introduction to the calculational techniques and key constructions and ideas of linear algebra. Students will also learn techniques for solving and understanding systems of linear differential equations. Additionally, this course serves as an introduction to formal mathematics; students will gain experience working at a level of generality and abstraction a bit above that encountered in a typical introductory calculus sequence.

HS,2088,NA,The Anthropology of Climate Change Adaptation,"Ebel, Sarah","This course offers a broad introduction to theories of adaptation to climate change and addresses the importance of understanding social and cultural factors when designing and implementing adaptation plans and policies. Climate change is a global phenomenon, yet adaptation to climatic changes will, in large part, be acted out at local and regional scales. In both the theory of adaptation and the implementation of adaptation policies, little attention has been given to the social and cultural factors that underlie and influence adaptation outcomes. Moreover, various forms of adaptation to climate change exist, and visions for adaptation are widely contested between individuals and groups who have diverse values, needs, and hopes for their futures. The contribution of anthropology through ethnography and mixed qualitative and quantitative methods to study individuals and communities can elucidate other factors that contribute to adaptation or maladaptation to climate change, including power differentials within communities and institutions, individuals’ well-being, and individuals’ visions for adaptation.

The course is divided into three units: (1) Conceptual and Applied Adaptation, which offers a broad introduction to the literature of adaptation in climate change and concepts of adaptive capacity and resilience, (2) Adaptation Strategies and Visions, which covers social and cultural values, visions, and strategies (such as livelihood diversification), and (3) Power Dynamics in Adaptation, which explores sociopolitical topics including poverty, migration, and social well-being. The course explores both urban and rural adaptation, but with a focus on rural, resource-dependent regions under the threat of climate change and globalization.

Students are evaluated on their participation and engagement in class discussion, reading responses, and three synthesis papers. The course emphasizes writing, and the reading responses will be the first attempt at a synthesis. I provide feedback which the students may use to write synthesis papers at the end of each unit. This is done to understand that writing and synthesizing is a process, and a skill which develops with time and practice.

We will explicitly compare methods, use of evidence and other aspects of different disciplinary approaches to the topic to highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach. This dimension of the class is particularly interesting because of the dynamic and interdisciplinary nature of scholarship right now that brings a wide range of research into dialogue. The course will focus intensively on helping students develop their own ideas and arguments in writing by focusing on writing as a process. Students will draft, write, revise and rewrite several short analytical essays with an eye toward clarifying their own argument, using text as evidence, and writing clearly and cohesively. Students will also be evaluated on their preparation for discussion and capacity to engage in a discussion-based exploration of the seminar readings.

ES,1070,QR,Calling Bullshit: Critical Data Literacy in the 21st Century,"Gatti, Daniel","Charlatans and hucksters have always been with us. But the age of computers and big data has increased the quantity of information that is thrown at us and it is increasingly difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. While fake news has been a focus of recent debate, it is easy to refute outright lies. However, there are more insidious ways of influencing debates that mix truth with sloppy reasoning.  In this course, we will study common, and often subtle, methods of bullshit used by people who wish to influence our thinking and behavior. We will begin with a taxonomy of bullshit and will learn to spot common techniques such as using logical fallacies, misrepresenting numerical data, and presenting partial truths. We will discuss the difference between anecdotes and data in supporting policy decisions. We will also cover how to clearly and quantitatively explain which parts of each example are nonsense, deceptive, or simply bullshit. We will also survey current news and events to identify and analyze examples of bullshit in the wild. We will focus on examples of bullshit that relate to questions of public health and environmental, economic, and racial justice. Students interested in becoming critical consumers and producers of information will benefit from this course. Students who complete this course will be able to identify bullshit, determine what is false or deceptive about the bullshit and offer a clear and persuasive refutation of the bullshit. As part of this process, students will learn to seek out relevant data, calculate and interpret averages, ratios and variances, and make simple graphics to examine the relationship between variables. Students with both technical and non- technical backgrounds will be valuable members of the class; the most important prerequisite is a desire to think critically. Evaluation will be through class participation, problem sets, and several short projects in  which students will detect, dissect, and refute bullshit.

MD,3013,NA,Sheep to Shawl,"Letcher, Susan","Sheep play profoundly important roles in human societies. This course is a human ecological exploration of sheep and wool, combined with a hands-on component in which we will work with sheep and learn fiber arts. This class will meet for one studio session and two lecture/discussion sections per week, plus at least one Saturday field trip. In the studio sessions, we will study sheep husbandry through visits to Peggy Rockefeller Farm, and learn a variety of techniques for working with wool, from the preparation (shearing, washing, and carding) to spinning and working with yarn (including knitting, crochet, and weaving). The lecture/discussion sessions will cover topics such as the ecological impacts of sheep in different parts of the world, the physics of spinning and the chemistry of dyes, and the symbolism of sheep in the mythology of different cultures. The course will draw on a wide range of material and intellectual approaches, with sheep and wool as the unifying theme. Students will be evaluated based on participation, short written assignments, and a final oral presentation.

MD,3013,NA,Sheep to Shawl,"Letcher, Susan","Sheep play profoundly important roles in human societies. This course is a human ecological exploration of sheep and wool, combined with a hands-on component in which we will work with sheep and learn fiber arts. This class will meet for one studio session and two lecture/discussion sections per week, plus at least one Saturday field trip. In the studio sessions, we will study sheep husbandry through visits to Peggy Rockefeller Farm, and learn a variety of techniques for working with wool, from the preparation (shearing, washing, and carding) to spinning and working with yarn (including knitting, crochet, and weaving). The lecture/discussion sessions will cover topics such as the ecological impacts of sheep in different parts of the world, the physics of spinning and the chemistry of dyes, and the symbolism of sheep in the mythology of different cultures. The course will draw on a wide range of material and intellectual approaches, with sheep and wool as the unifying theme. Students will be evaluated based on participation, short written assignments, and a final oral presentation.

ES,4050,ES QR,Population and Community Ecology,"Letcher, Susan","Ecology, in the narrowest sense, is the study of the distribution and abundance of organisms on the earth. This class focuses on ecology as a science, and particularly the intellectual tradition within ecology that has sought to develop simple mathematical descriptions of complex phenomena. Population ecology studies the growth and decline of populations (i.e., groups of organisms of the same species), while community ecology studies the interactions among populations. We will study classic models in population and community ecology, developing the models from first principles, applying them to real data, and critically examining the shortcomings of the modeling approach. Concepts to be covered in the class include exponential vs. logistic population growth, competition, predator-prey interactions, metapopulation dynamics, stochastic vs. deterministic processes, optimal foraging theory, succession, and behavioral ecology.This course will be useful for students who are considering graduate school in ecology and related disciplines, and it is open to anyone with relevant background knowledge and curiosity. Students will be evaluated based on participation in class discussions, a series of problem sets, and a final paper.

HS,2090,HS,Postcolonial Studies and Psychoanalysis II,"van Vliet, Netta","This course considers the definition of the human through a focus on scholarship in postcolonial studies that has been informed by psychoanalysis. The course is the second in a sequence, following Postcolonial Studies and Psychoanalysis I. While the latter served as an introduction to the ways in which Postcolonial Studies and Psychoanalysis have been brought to bear on one another, this course will go in depth to focus on the thought of a select group of thinkers in postcolonial studies (e.g. Gayatri Spivak, Jacques Derrida, Frantz Fanon), whose work has been shaped by psychoanalysis. In so doing, this course will bring questions about sexual difference to bear on considerations of colonial and postcolonial difference. 

Both postcolonial studies and psychoanalysis engage questions of sexualized and racialized difference in the context of 20th century Europe and the legacies of colonialism. Postcolonial studies and psychoanalysis both also contend with notions of individual and collective well-being, and with belonging and exclusion. Psychoanalysis is a colonial discipline which produced a form of analysis that emerged in the time of colonialism. As such, psychoanalysis contributed to colonial notions of civilized and primitive, of man and woman, of normal and abnormal, of Europe and its others. At the same time, however, contexts of anticolonial struggle in turn shaped psychoanalytic thought. By examining texts in postcolonial studies that are informed by psychoanalysis, this course considers processes through which individuated subjects become defined in terms of collective groups of belonging such as the nation, and how filiation and family is connected to affiliation and nation, through relations of affect, sexual difference, and concepts of representational politics. Students will be evaluated based on class participation, reading responses, a mid-term essay and final paper.

HS,2091,HS,Forms of Poetry,"Mahoney, Daniel","This class is a study of, and a writing workshop in, poetic forms.  We will look at constraints, techniques, and directions of contemporary poetry through intensive reading, writing, and criticism of our own poetic work.  This background is useful and significant for the study of poetry at any level, and is especially helpful in light of the fact that, for better or worse, free verse techniques have dominated poetry in the twentieth century.  This course is valuable for practiced poets, emerging poets, and prose writers alike. Forms of Poetry asks students to pay attention, create poetry of attention, and revel in poetry that is attentive to language; this process will help students develop voice and lyrical content in their own writing. We will look older, “received forms” (Sonnet, Ghazal, Villanelle) and create our own forms by using experimental techniques (homophonic translation, concrete poetry, erasure, nonsense words (i.e. Jabberwocky)) and look to end the term with the amazing Japanese form, Zuihitsu. You might be thinking: Why write with these crazy constraints or in these old timey poetic forms? And what the heck is a Zuihitsu? Those are good questions, questions we will address on a weekly basis.  Over the last seventy years, the debates over poetic expression have been shaped in visceral ways, from “raw” versus “cooked,” “academic” versus “beat,” “formal” versus “antiformal.”  This class is designed to deepen your knowledge of these debates and to inspire you to draw upon a variety of modes in your own writing.  Evaluations:  Students will be expected to contribute to a class blog, write several poems a week, revise poetic output, participate in class workshop, and hand sew a chapbook of their own revised, creative work.

ES,3084,NA,Tutorial: Chemical Origins of Life,"Hudson, Reuben","The origin of life remains one of science’s greatest unresolved questions. In this tutorial, students will delve into competing theories regarding the chemical origins of life on Earth and other planets. Of the many environments proposed as potential hatcheries for the first living beings, alkaline hydrothermal vents stand out for providing a remarkable link between geology and biology. These vents are not volcanic, but produced by “serpentinization”, i.e. the reaction of the ubiquitous mineral olivine with water in the mantle, which results in the release of alkaline fluids (OH–), hydrogen (H2), sulphides (HS–), and ammonia (NH3). The fluids would have percolated through the crust and met seawater, which, due to anoxic conditions and high volcanic activity on the early Earth, was comparatively acidic (H+), and rich in carbon dioxide (CO2), ferrous iron (Fe2+), and nickel (Ni2+). The meeting of these two fluids produced the precipitation of iron (and nickel)-sulphur clusters (Fe(Ni)S), which we will investigate as a catalyst for the production of organic compounds from CO2. In a collaboration with researchers from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, and the Ludwig Maximillian University of Munich, we will build a microfluidic device that mimics in a laboratory setting, the conditions of an early-Earth hydrothermal vent (high temperature, high pressure, and inclusion of the various gaseous and ionic solutes). This microfluidic device will connect directly to a mass spectrometer (MS) to analyse the production of organic compounds. If organic compounds are detected by MS, further characterization via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) will be carried out at Colby College. Students will be evaluated based on their participation in the discussion of primary literature and their laboratory work. Participation in this tutorial will be a prerequisite for any student wishing to participate in a paid summer internship (potentially coupled with a Fall or Spring term) at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab.

Through this course, I propose to introduce students to the accumulated knowledge of wild bee biology and ecology through an examination of bee taxa found throughout the world and also those taxa of significance to Maine’s agricultural and native habitats. The overarching rationale of the course is that by gaining a deepened knowledge of bee biology and ecology, students will better understand the challenges and significance of bee conservation. Through readings, discussion, and lectures we will explore basic bee biology, including evolution, sociality, taxonomy, physiology, and behavior. We will also explore plant/bee interactions with a focus on pollination ecology and bee/floral evolution. Lab time will include learning how to build and manage a bee collection, identification of bee specimens to genus and, for selected genera, to species, and study of bee foraging ecology. The course will include at least one Saturday half-day field trip. Students will be evaluated on: 1) exams, 2) participation in discussion and lab, 3) creation of a bee collection including correct bee identification, and 4) a final project. The final project will be a review paper on a subject of the student’s choosing.

This course is devoted to understanding the origins of the grain and its cultivation, the social and economic impact of riziculture, the technical term for rice cultivation, in many of the parts of the world where it has been the foundation grain, and to sampling some of the myriad ways the grain is prepared. The primary goal is to learn about rice through readings, discussion, writing assignments, and preparation of rice-based dishes, in order to provide deep historical and cultural perspectives on the way rice has shaped civilizations around the world, but with a particular focus on Asia. The course will also foreground how historians go about their work using the historical work on rice to examine the questions of the use of evidence and argumentation as well as the conceptual underpinnings of that work. Class will also include hands on cooking and eating assignments designed to connect the scholarly work of the class with learning to cook and savor rice.

HS,4080,NA,Land and Climate,"Stabinsky, Doreen","A changing climate affects land, forest, and agricultural ecosystems, with predominantly negative impacts projected in most regions of the world. At the same time, human activities in these ecosystems contribute significantly to global emissions of greenhouse gases and consequent planetary warming and climate change. Yet land and ecosystem-based activities are also looked to as potential solutions to climate change, ranging from small-scale agroecological production of crops and livestock to large-scale bioenergy-based geoengineering approaches. Cutting across all these dimensions of land-climate interactions are the climate impacts of and on food production, food security, and livelihoods based on food and farming.

In this course we survey scientific and policy literature on these intersections between land and climate change. Much of the material surveyed draws from and builds on the 2019 special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on land and climate.

This course is premised on the following questions: What are our moral obligations to other animals? Should non-human animals have legal rights and moral standing? If so, on what basis? How does the moral treatment of animals change across the contexts of food, research, captivity, and the home? Do we have different ethical obligations to wild and domestic animals? Historically, western philosophers construct the “animal” in opposition to the human. Why? What is an “animal” and why is the “human” contrasted with it? How do we use the concept of the “animal” to delimit our concept of the “human”? How does language shape and produce our relationships with animals?

Students will be encouraged to compare the old and the contemporary on a range of topics including the development of human ecology, the idea of democracy, the governance system and the ACM, landscape and architecture on the physical campus, the 1983 fire and recovery, the cultural and financial relationship of the college to Bar Harbor and MDI, trends in student demographics, and COA’s own mutations in relation to changes in the outside world. Readings will be chosen to reconstruct the intellectual conditions of the era, using all or parts of Rene Dubos’ So Human an Animal, Loren Eiseley's The Immense Journey, Ian McHarg's Design with Nature, C.P. Snow’s ""The Two Cultures,"" A.N. Whitehead’s ""The Aims of Education,"" Scott & Helen Nearing's ""Living the Good Life"" and Samuel Eliot Morison’s ""Story of Mount Desert Island,"" along with early COA mission statements, founding documents, oral and written histories including Such a Frail Bark, Less Whales More Latin, COA: The First Three Decades, and the Ed Kaelber videos. Students will choose and pursue a specific topic in COA history; evaluation will be based on a report midway through the term and final paper due Week 10. This course will be a look at where we have come from and what we are.

There are two goals: to develop the students' understanding of the dynamics of organizational development and the planning and implementation of projects in the context Latin America in general and Mexico in particular, and to develop the practical skills to engage in such organizational development and project work. 

Students will read about and practice grant-writing to prepare to apply for grants, and will meet with local authorities and government state government officials.  Guest-speakers who work on local grassroots projects will provide students with information on how social projects have developed in the area. Readings will include theory and cases studies such Howard Richard's La Evaluación de Accion Cultural as well as documents from government and NGO groups in Mexico. 

The final project for the tutorial will be the development of a strategic plan for a Literacy Program for the community of Chochola, Yucatan, to be implemented at a later time. Students will be evaluated based on the extent to which progress is demonstrated in achieving the two goals of this tutorial, through conversation check-in's with the professor, the production of a journal and other reflective writings through the term, the documentation of work on the development of a strategic plan, and the strategic plan itself.

In this seminar and workshop, we’ll look at examples of contemporary work that employ or reference procedures that are devised from the occult/psychic realms. Through this mystical lens we will explore the work of writers from previous generations such as Robert Graves, Italo Calvino, Robert Creeley, Philip Whalen and Hannah Weiner and key current figures like Alice Notley, Leslie Marmon Silko, CA Conrad, Hoa Nguyen, Wendy C. Ortiz and Ariana Reines, and read about how and why literary artists have turned to these pathways.

HS,2093,HS,Strategies for Social Change,"Cox, Gray","People organize to bring social change for many reasons – e. g. to end oppression, bring peace, prevent ecological collapse, promote cultural survival or advance sectarian interests. The character and success of strategies depend on social and historical contexts. People typically alternate between – or combine – varied approaches including: social movements, electoral politics, lobbying, nonviolent (or sometimes violent) struggle, technological innovation, social entrepreneurship and community organizing. This course uses theories of social movements as a starting point to look at strategies for social change and criteria for evaluating them. The course assumes it is important to understand views and strategies we disagree with respectfully and with careful analysis. The class combines readings in history and theories of social change, and diverse case studies from both the left and the right. It looks both at classic cases (e. g. Gandhi, King) and a variety of efforts from recent years and the present (e.g. Indivisible, the Tea Party, #MeToo, Zapatistas, 350.org, Black Lives Matter, Cambridge Analytica, and alternative food system entrepreneurship). This is a course for students who want to develop skills for doing critical analysis of society, for developing effective plans to create social change, and for applying strategies to implement those plans. Evaluation will be based on progress in developing those skills as demonstrated in homework and class participation, short papers, and a term project developing a sample strategy document for a viewpoint of the student’s choice.

Cubism, Surrealism, Expressionism, Constructivism, Arte Povera, Social Realism, among others — these artist movements were initiated through group declarations of common aesthetic purpose. Variance within artist conventions and procedures accelerated during moments of unrest and social progression thus providing a range of counter-narratives to canonical histories of the period. The last quarter of the twentieth century was one in which new discourses informed creative production and art mono-cultures gave way to intersectional experience. Theories advanced by Edward Said, Frantz Fanon, Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock, and Judith Butler offered new networks with which to understand how art operates as both a reflection and critique of culture. This art history survey looks at how different artists engaged with theories of the unconscious, radical political programs, social upheaval, gender politics, and scientific advances; and, how diverse receptions of human experience were expressed through artistic production. Anxiety, joy, curiosity, and activist predilection combine to formulate a rich amalgam of fresh and challenging visions of the world.

It will look at a mix of classic and contemporary short texts that exemplify good writing about these general questions. It will also look at current cases and applications of these ideas in the news of the day. Using a College Seminar format, the course will emphasize the writing process to practice skills to formulate, thoughtfully analyze, and revise views about these issues. The course goals are to develop student skills in the critical analysis of arguments and texts and to increase skills in writing clear expositions and persuasive prose. It will include some reading materials and in-class exercises to explore alternative writing processes. Course assignments will include brief homework activities, short papers with revised versions of each, and one longer research paper providing an extended revision of an earlier piece. Students will be evaluated based on the extent to which their class participation, homework and writing assignments demonstrate substantive progress on the course goals. Class sessions will alternate between seminar discussions, short lectures and peer review sessions of papers.

How can we make sense of such vast data to prioritize genes or genetic variants that may help us to treat human diseases? How can we protect ourselves from spurious and irreproducible results? In this course, we will learn fundamental techniques of data analysis for RNA and DNA sequencing data. The course will begin by surveying the technology behind high-throughput sequencing and will progress to alignment of RNA reads to a reference genome. We will then learn how to identify differentially expressed genes using methods that correct for potential biases and correlation structure in the data. Next, we will combine DNA sequences with gene expression data to understand how genetic variation produces differences in gene expression levels. Students interested in learning widely applicable bioinformatics techniques will benefit from this course.

Reason and revelation have been in tension, as modes of seeking knowledge or truth, since classical times and they remain so today. Furthermore, the literary imagination has made “fictions” about science and scientists for as long as the terms have had cultural meaning (in English, since the 14th century). This course will examine some of these fictions, moving from past to present. We will look at how “science” became a topic for Western literature and how that literature, especially over the last three hundred years, has considered and reflected scientific thought. We will notice how scientists have been treated in imaginative works ranging from celebration to satire. We will think about how and when intelligence and knowledge came to be associated with the scientist rather than the artist or theologian, despite science’s initial alliance with art, and whether that association is changing. Students will participate actively in the seminar and will also write and revise four short critical analyses. There will be a final take-home examination.

The bicycle is one of the most amazing inventions of the 19th century. With 25 pounds of metal, plastic and rubber, a person can propel themselves at staggering speeds of 20 miles per hour or more. Bicycles are a clean, healthy and efficient mode of transportation, yet they struggle to maintain relevance in some countries. In this course, we will study how this came to be in the United States and look at how other countries treat bicycles as transportation. The course will be divided into three roughly equal parts: History, Science and Policy. In the History module, we will start with the development of the bicycle in the late 1800s and study its impact on society as an example of how technology disrupts societal patterns. We will study the influence of the bicycle on mobility for the poor and for women, with Frances Willard and Annie Londonderry as examples. We will look at novel uses of bicycles in developing countries and in war. In the Science module, we will study the physics of bicycles, including gear ratios, brake leverage, steering geometry and ergonomics.  In the Policy module, we will study how rights to publicly funded roadways changed in the 20th century, with a focus on the American experience in removing pedestrians, animals and bicycles from the streets. We will also look at bicycle policy and street use in other countries to see how policy can shape behavior. Students interested in the history and physics of bicycles as well as how corporate power can co-opt public resources will benefit from this course. Students who complete this course will have an understanding of the development of the bicycle, the physics and mechanics of bicycles, and of the policy decisions that led modern roads to be dominated by the automobile.

AD,3036,NA,Digital Design: Visual Communication in Digital Media,"Lowgren, Jonas","Graphic design and visual communication is increasingly taking place in digital media, which implies a range of new possibilities as well as challenges for designers and communicators. Digital media is interactive, offering viewers the possibilities to engage and explore through individualized experiences. These experiences are also collaborative, turning audiences into networks of communicating peers. Participatory experiences are also amorphous, combining previously distinct media forms such as text, image, audio and video into a dynamic occurrence. 

This course is for students interested in learning effective visual communication through digital media. We explore the two cornerstones for building design aptitude: a repertoire of design examples, and practical skills. This will be realized through recurring discussions, a series of design exercises, and a final project. The digital design genres we will concentrate on include information design, visualization, data journalism and collaborative media. A user-centered perspective will be adopted throughout, involving methods and techniques to design for user experience (UX).  Evaluation will be based on active participation in and contribution to class discussions (20%), course exercises (30%) and a final project (50%).

HS,3090,HS,Homesteading: Theory and Practice,"Collum, Kourtney","This course examines homesteading as an economic and cultural practice. Maine is a center of homesteading activity in the United States and an ideal place to study the theory and practice of homesteading. From a food systems perspective, homesteading represents a means of divesting from the global food system through the practice of subsistence agriculture and food preservation. Viewed from an anthropological perspective, homesteading raises interesting questions about why some individuals eschew conventional lifestyles and seek significant degrees of self-sufficiency, various forms of intentional living, and commitments to non-commodified production. A critical examination of homesteading raises questions about privilege and the benefits and limits of social movements founded on personal choice and private property. And viewed through economics, homesteading can be seen as a choice to resist the intrusion of market-based relationships into social life and an attempt to restore social relationships and normative values other than efficiency to production and consumption.

Applying these lenses, this course will examine the conditions that influence contemporary homesteading practices. Three key questions frame the course: (1) What motivates self-identified homesteaders to resist normative lifestyles and seek self-sufficient, non-commodified ways of living? (2) How do variables such as class, education, race, geographic location, and property-ownership shape homesteading practices? (3) What are the benefits and limits of homesteading as a form of resistance to commodified production and consumption? Through readings and fieldwork, students will attempt to answer these questions. Readings will include personal and ethnographic accounts of homesteading as well as critical studies of non-commodified living. Fieldwork will include four daytrips to homesteads. Students will be evaluated based on participation, interviewing exercises, a field journal, and a series of reflection papers.

HS,4069,HS,Leaving Capitalism,"Taylor, Davis","Markets are the dominant form of economic organization in the world today: particularly in the Global North, the vast majority of people sell their specialized labor to earn money, and use the money to obtain, via markets, the goods and services they need or desire. However, since the earliest days of capitalistic production, there were voices that articulated deep-seated critiques of capitalism while finding value in non-commodified production and consumption. These voices are still with us today, along with those who seek to act on such critiques by meeting much of their material needs through non-market means such as self-production, acts of reciprocity, and, and gift exchange. This course examines theories, concepts, and experiences centered on this practice of ""leaving capitalism"": seeking food, shelter, and clothing to the greatest degree possible through non-commodified production and consumption, in places where commodified production and consumption are the dominant norms.  We will examine counter-hegemonic activities, particularly homesteading, that seek to restore visible, non-exploitive relationships to production activities, thus challenging commodity fetishism and alienation (in Marxist terms) and narrow definitions of economic efficiency (in Neoclassical terms). We will lean heavily on theories and case studies of diverse/ community/ solidarity economies as articulated by JK Gibson-Graham, Ethan Miller, and others; other topics will include capitalism (alienation and commodification), Buddhist/ Gandhian economics (which emphasizes local economies, community self-reliance), work (the nature of work, what constitutes good work), resistance/avoidance (James C. Scott), and degrowth. By studying and integrating these ideas as they relate to production, consumption, and social relations, we will also seek to redefine contemporary economics beyond its traditional emphasis on commodity production, restoring ""the social"" to this social science.

HS,1077,HS,Ethnographic Writing,"van Vliet, Netta","Ethnographic writing, literally the ""writing of a people,"" is anthropology’s primary disciplinary mode of representation, based on participant-observation fieldwork. Early ethnographies were usually written by anthropologists from Europe and the United States about people they had studied in other parts of the world. In the 1970s and on, critical questions about representation increasingly challenged assumptions about ethnographic work, raising questions about objectivity, transparency, politics and the relationship of ethnographers to the people and places about  which they are writing. This class will introduce students to a range of ethnographies in the discipline of anthropology, as well as to some of the political, cultural, and intellectual debates and contexts in which these ethnographies were produced. At the same time, we will consider epistemological, ethical, philosophical and methodological issues that such writing involves, including questions about representation, translation, difference and interpretation. In addition to classic ethnographies, we will also read some fiction, travel writing, and journalism. We will consider questions about how ethnographic knowledge is authorized, how assumptions about interpretation shape ethnographic writing, relations between individual and group, and the relations between author and reader. Students will be asked to experiment with ethnographic writing themselves, through a series of short writing assignments as well as a final project. The course is designed to allow students to workshop their own writing.

HS,0955,NA,Writing for Yourself: An Introduction to Technique,"Cass, Blake","Good writing comes from a desire to communicate; great writing comes from a desire to connect. Far from being a removed activity without consequences, writing offers us the chance to encounter the world, better understand others, and reflect on who we are. Starting with descriptive writing, students will write in a variety of genres, including narrative nonfiction and the analytical essay. No matter the genre, students will be expected to put the full force of themselves into their writing; an analytical essay is, though in a much different way, as much an exploration of the self as a memoir. In his epistolary book, Between the World and Me, Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote, “You are growing into consciousness, and my wish for you is that you feel no need to constrict yourself to make other people comfortable.” Coates’s advice to his son could serve as the mantra for students in this course. In other words, write for yourself, write to explore who you are and what you think, write to live more fully. Using The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2018, a multi-genre anthology of work by contemporary writers, students will gain an understanding of defining, comparing and contrasting, classification and division, and writing process analysis. To improve grammar and syntax, each student will receive an individualized grammar plan. In addition to our two weekly classes, we will meet on Wednesdays to either work on grammar exercises or venture into Acadia for some place-based writing. In short writing assignments, students will apply the four fundamentals of good writing–crafting concise sentences, ordering words for emphasis, choosing strong verbs, and using active voice. In addition, students will complete four major writing assignments that allow them to develop their voices and experiment with structure. Evaluation for the course is based on the quality of writing, improvement of rewrites, and overall diligence and effort.  This course carries only institutional credit.

HS,1078,W HS,College Seminar: Truth and Alternative Facts,"Mahoney, Daniel","""Alternative facts"" and ""fake news"" have fueled growing concerns that we are living in, what playwright Steve Tesich called (in 1992!), a ""post-truth"" society. With the rise of media outlets, the postmodernist take on the death of objective truth, and the sound bite culture we live it, ""post-truth"" seems inevitable.  But what exactly is truth in the first place, and why should we care about it? We will address this question over the course of this term by examining contemporary views on the role of truth in meaning and communication, challenges to these views from uncertainty and subjectivity, and arguments for and against different conceptions of truth.  For example, the first lines of Charlotte Delbo's memoir ""Auschwitz and After"" reads, ""Today I am not sure that what I wrote is true. I am certain it is truthful.""  As contemporary writers and thinkers, how can we reckon with such a statement?  Is there a difference between the truth of a writer and the truth of a politician?  How can we ever know if anything is true or false if it's all relative?  In short: what hath postmodernism wrought?  Using a college seminar format, the course will emphasize the writing process-prewriting, writing, and rewriting; course assignments will include short papers and one longer research paper. Students will be evaluated not only on their participation in class discussions, peer reviews, and writing workshops but also on their overall improvement in writing.

It almost always features a dissolving of boundaries--of the living and dead, the normal and the paranormal, the mind and the exterior world. In stories, ghosts often haunt, but they stand for memories and past events, and the spaces they inhabit are often charged with meanings and emotions. A house can be a metaphor for the body, the mind, for comfort or for patriarchal oppression. Rooms can hold secrets. This genre relates to the psychology of the self, memory, isolation, the uncanny and mysteries of the relationship of body and spirit. This course is part of a three-credit program centered on the production of a short narrative film. Students will study various texts, films, and theoretical writings, concerning topics to include: haunting, spaces of house and home, identity, paranormal, and memory.  We will explore some Maine connections to the genre. There are rich associations with houses and other spaces as demonstrated in the work of Gaston Bachelard, Carl Jung, Shirley Jackson and Toni Morrison. Whether literary (Turn of the Screw, The Tell Tale Heart, The Haunting of Hill House) theatrical (séances, Haunted Hotel) or cinematic (Us!, Hausu), we will use texts—books, plays, movies, poems—as research to better understand the movie(s) we are creating.

ES,2037,ES,Introductory Entomology,"Graham, Carrie","Nearly 80% of all described species belong to the class Insecta.  Due to their abundance, diversity and adaptability, insects are crucial components of terrestrial, freshwater and human-made ecosystems.  Students with a background in entomology can apply their knowledge of insects to many other fields, including botany, ecology, anthropology, epidemiology and medicine, agriculture, climate change, visual arts, history, and even the culinary arts.  This course will give students a sampling of entomological applications within these diverse fields.  Students will be given a solid introduction to insect biology, ecology, taxonomy and identification through lectures, lab sessions and field trips.  They will assemble their own insect collections and will learn to identify all Maine insect orders and many common insect families.  Lectures, field trips and readings will emphasize the important role of insects in human lives and our impact on the environment.  Students will be evaluated on their insect collections, performance on lab quizzes, participation and one paper with presentation.

HS,2096,HS,"Nature, Humans, and Philosophy","Lakey, Heather","According to CoA’s website, Human Ecology studies the relationship between humans and their natural, cultural, built and technological environments. But what do we mean by “nature” and what distinguishes a natural environment from a cultural one? Moreover, what kind of relationships should we cultivate with our natural environments? This discussion-based course offers a philosophical and ethical exploration into the concept of nature. We will draw on a variety of readings from environmental ethics, ecofeminism, deep ecology, American philosophy, Taoism, and Post-Structuralism in order to critically interrogate our understanding of nature, as well as our ethical beliefs regarding human responsibility to the natural world. We will read selections from thinkers such as Aristotle, Carolyn Merchant, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ramachandra Guha, Aldo Leopold, John Muir, Arne Naess, Val Plumwood, Kate Soper, Mark Sagoff, Vandana Shiva, Gary Snyder, Henry David Thoreau, Lao Tzu, Terry Tempest Williams, and others.

In the first half of the course, we will examine different philosophical frameworks that theorize the idea of nature and environmental responsibility. Guiding questions include the following: What is “nature”? How is the concept of nature politicized and socially constructed? Do we have moral obligations to nature? How should humans relate to nature? What assumptions drive the conceptual distinction between humans and nature? During the second half of the course, we will pivot our attention to specific ethical topics such as: control over natural resources, environmental justice, the land ethic, rights for non-human objects, wilderness, and sustainability and consumption. Throughout the course, we will revisit questions pertaining to philosophy and environmental activism, and we will consider how philosophy can help us to articulate our ethical responsibilities to our natural environments.

Upon completion of this course, students will have gained a richer philosophical understanding of the idea of nature and they will be familiar with key debates in environmental ethics. Course requirements include weekly writing assignments, a midterm exam, a final paper, and class participation. There are no prerequisites, but students should arrive to this class prepared to engage difficult philosophical texts and to share their ideas with others.

HS,4086,HS,Derrida and Questions of Difference,"van Vliet, Netta","Algerian Jewish philosopher, Jacques Derrida (1930-2004), one of the most widely translated French philosophers of the 20th century, developed a body of work often referred to as ""deconstruction."" Derrida’s oeuvre has influenced multiple fields and disciplines, including Literature, Anthropology, Philosophy, Postcolonial Studies, Psychoanalysis and Feminist Theory. This course will track some of the ways in which Derrida engaged with ideas of difference, through a focus on questions his work poses for understandings of the human. The class will engage with Derrida’s archive through reading some of his early work, including essays and interviews about the status of writing and speech, language, and philosophy, and then move through his later work, including his increasing focus on explicitly political topics such as the death penalty, the animal, sovereignty, and war. Although the texts we read will be primarily Derrida’s own writing, we will also read authors who respond to and build on Derrida’s thought. These may include Gayatri Spivak, Ranjana Khanna, Samir Haddad, Peggy Kamuf, and Michael Naas, as well as texts by those with whom Derrida was in dialogue, such as Sigmund Freud, Hélène Cixous, Michel Foucault, Sarah Kofman, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Karl Marx, Martin Heidegger and Emmanuel Levinas. As we move through Derrida’s texts and those informed by them, we will pay particular attention to questions about sexual difference, colonialism, the human, death in relation to life, and representation. Students will be evaluated on participation in seminar discussions, weekly reading responses, a mid-term paper and final paper. There are no prerequisites for this course, but students will be expected to conduct close readings of challenging texts. Students are encouraged to contact the professor with any questions about the course and whether it is a good fit for them.

Through virtual field trips of various parks, students will visualize how regional climate and surface processes such as rivers, glaciers, and wind interact with the bedrock and surficial materials to produce some of the most iconic landscapes. While Acadia National Park offers a view of an ancient and eroded supervolcano, Yellowstone offers a glimpse of a dynamic landscape built on a modern supervolcano. While a few glaciers still cling to the high peaks of Glacier National Park, Yosemite hosts steep glacially carved valleys and polished domes reminiscent of a glaciated past. Class time will be used for lectures, discussions of readings, and laboratory exercises. During labs, students will get to know approximately 6 different parks in detail through interaction with geologic maps, rock samples, aerial imagery, and scientific reports.

ES,1076,ES,Polar Ecology and Exploration,"Todd, Sean","The Arctic and Antarctic represent some of the most extreme environments on the planet. As physical places, both poles play an important role in governing the planet’s climate and heat flow. Both are suspected to be rich in minerals and are thought to perhaps hold short-term relief from current world shortages in natural resources. As ecosystems, both are hugely productive in spite of, and in part because of the extreme temperatures they experience; certain species are found nowhere else and in fact thrive in these remote locales. Superimposed upon these natural environments is the presence of humans. Exploration of both areas has been particularly focused in the past century, with countless stories of the perseverance and persistence of our pioneering spirit. Initially surveyed to forward nationalistic agendas, both poles are now sites of scientific inquiry. In particular, the political model that currently governs Antarctica as one massive Protected Area has no precedent and perhaps suggests a way forward for environmental agendas working on global scales. More recently, the poles have been exploited by ecotourism businesses.

This class examines the provinces of the Arctic and Antarctic, wildernesses whose boundaries can be defined physically, biologically, geologically and politically. We will examine the rich and highly adapted diversity of life as it is affected by local and global oceanography and atmospheric science, and assess the impacts of climate change on these fragile environments. We will also review our relationship with these places and examine what future we might play in preserving, and/or exploiting the polar regime, using Human Ecology as a model for our understanding.

We will combine readings, discussions, and individual exploration throughout the term. Our meetings will be seminar discussion style, allowing us to bring together our different perspectives and ideas in response to readings and any independent research. We will explore questions such as What defines a library? How are libraries socially and politically situated and used in institutions and communities? What purposes do libraries serve or could potentially serve in these contexts, while considering the possible evolution of libraries in the future. Simultaneously we will observe libraries of the COA and MDI communities, including informal, personal, and formal library collections.
       
The group will meet twice a week for an hour and a half for a seminar style class. We will discuss the readings and present interests we are exploring on our own.

GS,6018,NA,Skeleton Articulation,"Jolley, Olivia","The purpose of this group study is to develop skills in skeleton articulation as a result of shared interest in the use of skeletons in museum work, education, art, and other applications.

The learning objectives for this class are to understand the processes used to prepare bones for skeleton articulation (maceration, degreasing, whitening, etc); become familiar with multiple methods of articulation through in-class instruction and discussions; understand how musculature, organ systems, and other tissues influence the positioning of bones; and gain a better understanding of the anatomy of various organisms.

The course goals for students are to become competent in at least one method of articulation; be able to identify different types of bone and where they belong; assemble a skeleton with anatomical accuracy; assemble a skeleton in a pose that is true to the organism; assemble a skeleton in its entirety; and create an articulation deemed quality enough to be displayed in the college's museum.

Participants will meet these objectives and outcomes by meeting as a class three hours each week and working on articulations and research outside of class time, spending a total of at least 15 academically engaged hours per week on this group study.

Each student will spend the term working on one research project that is part of broader ongoing community-based work in the MDI region. Topics for student projects will be tied to existing local projects and in collaboration with researchers, educators, and community members. The projects may follow a wide range of formats and should connect to student interests. Some examples of possible projects include: investigating seasonal variation in groundwater chemistry, identifying the resource needs of high school educators teaching data literacy based on geoscience datasets, or the review and synthesis of the state of EPA standards for the acceptable limits for chemicals found in drinking water. After choosing a project, students will ask questions of existing data, review existing literature, design the next phase of a project, collect observations, and make interpretations based on those observations. Each week, students will practice writing and peer review of project components: proposal preparation, literature review, methodology description, presentation of results or products, interpretation and synthesis connected to prior work, and potential future work. Class time will be used for lectures, meetings with visiting collaborators, a few local field trips, student presentations, and writing instruction and revision. Students will be evaluated based on their weekly written work, their ability to meet milestones throughout the project work, and their final dissemination (report and oral presentation) of their project.

MD,1020,NA,Social Arts Practice & Community-based Marine Conservation I,"Rock, Jennifer","This course extends conservation management thinking on what are ‘healthy’ marine ecosystems, specifically to include local social values. We investigate ways to capture community perspectives on marine conservation, using social arts practice to enable expression of perceptions/values/knowledge through visual narratives. The course will include recorded lectures, and a weekly real-time discussion session on both lectures and reading material. Assigned readings focus on participatory marine conservation management; community engagement methods; social arts practice; visual ethnography; visual communication and arts-based research. 

Course evaluation will be based on project work, short presentations and assigned readings. The project work includes (1) contribution to a group visual research project on representing local marine issues, and (2) an individual creative research project that incorporates public perceptions research (e.g. how do people value the marine environment) with an emphasis on visual expression of values. The research element might interrogate existing virtual visual resources, or collect new visual representations through on-line ‘surveying’. The individual projects will be summarised in a final report that will include an element of evaluation, by using action research to critically examine your expectations, intentions, and observations of the research process, as well as outcomes. Students will also be evaluated on several short presentations on assigned course material, and on written responses to assigned readings, recorded weekly in a conceptual journal. 

The course is a companion to but not a prerequisite for a subsequent course that will include a practical field component where, as a group, we design and implement a community-engaged social art project on a local marine conservation issue in Frenchman’s Bay.

We will cover how ecology influences tree and forest growth, natural and artificial forest regeneration, treatments that shape forest composition, and finally different types of timber harvests and how they are done. We’ll look at managing forests for timber, wildlife, recreation, non-timber forest products, and more. In addition to a solid understanding of forest management, students will come away with the skills and vocabulary used by foresters to measure tree and forest value, growth, and health. Students will learn through lectures and primarily through doing— field trips will be an important part of this class. We’ll tour forests that are managed in different ways and meet with foresters working with small landowners, land conservation organizations, and private businesses. Students will be evaluated by class participation, problem sets, and a midterm and final test that will take place in and out of the classroom.

HS,1081,HS HY,US Presidential Elections: From Whistle Stops to Digital Flo,"McKown, Jamie","This online course will provide a survey of American Presidential elections dating back to the rise of televised advertising in 1952. We will cover each campaign since, looking at the candidates, the issues, the major campaign themes, messaging, and persuasion vehicles. There will be a heavy emphasis placed on unpacking the various forms of mass communication that each candidate employed. This might mean television, radio, direct mail, social media, etc. The class will be taught entirely online in a primarily asynchronous format. Students will watch short videos from the instructor accompanied by secondary readings and a host of digitized primary artifacts for them to explore. The goal of the course is to acquaint students with the history of presidential elections in the United States while also giving them the opportunity to critically evaluate how political communication and messaging is expressed through various mass communication mediums.  In addition, there will be regularized real time virtual discussion sessions with the instructor and other members of the class, as well as a more asynchronous message board for group posting. There will be multiple such sessions per week, and the timing will vary in order to accommodate student scheduling. Students will be expected to participate in a minimum number of these sessions. There will be a midterm and final analytical essay assignment, both of which will synthesize themes across the various campaigns we will be studying.  Evaluation will be based on completion of the midterm and final essay, engagement with the discussion sections, and a final virtual “debriefing” with the instructor.

HS,3096,HS HY,Cold War Flashpoints: Exploring Case Studies,"McKown, Jamie","This online course will explore a series of “flash points” or case studies from across the entirety of the Cold War period. Some of these case studies will be prominent and well known to students, while others may be more obscure. Topics covered may include, but are not limited to, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Berlin Airlift, Kennedy and the construction of the Berlin Wall, NSC 68, Operation Popeye, the Greek Civil War, Able Archer, the ""New Look"" Doctrine of the Eisenhower administration, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the development of spaced-based weapons during the 1980s. The actual cases covered will vary depending on the term and student interests. This class will be offered in a non-linear and asynchronous online format. Students will tackle each case study as an individual module. Each module will include an overview from the instructor, readings, and an assignment relevant to that module. Depending on the module, these assignments might involve reflective writing responses, primary document analysis, virtual archival work, or some other form of creative expression. Students will be able to select the modules they are most interested in from a series of options. They can explore them in whatever order they choose and on their own timeline for completion.  In addition, there will be regularized real time virtual discussion sessions with the instructor and other members of the class as well as a more asynchronous message board for group posting. There will be multiple such sessions per week, and the timing will vary in order to accommodate student scheduling. Students will be expected to participate in a minimum number of these sessions. Final projects for the class will involve individual students selecting a case study of their own and building their own ""module"" that might be used by students in a future course. This includes recording (audio or video) a short overview, curating a series of readings, and also developing an assignment.  This final project will likely involve undertaking additional primary and secondary research, including potentially mocking up FOIA requests for documents. Evaluation will be based on completion of the various module assignments, engagement with the discussion sections, and the final project. This course is ideally suited for students who have taken either of our existing Cold War offerings (early or later years). However, those students who have not taken either of these classes, but who have a background or interest in the topics we are covering are also welcome. In the latter case, they should contact the instructor directly to determine if the class is well suited for them.

This course is concerned with the visualization of what is in the landscape. There will be an observational drawing module within the course. The majority of the course will center around visual material curated and presented to you on-line. Course readings will engage with a variety of texts written by artists, art historians, geographers, historians, writers, and cultural theorists that address the invention of the modern idea of wilderness and landscape – and these will be set in context with works that engage with the visual and phenomenological reception of the artist’s mind. Viewed as a regular practice, the descriptive power of drawing can intensify the experience of observational fieldwork, provide the draughtsperson with a richer understanding of the cycles within a landscape, and deepen our relationship with the natural world.

Bacteria and viruses have an effect on their hosts that far outweighs their microscopic size. In this course, we will study the fundamentals of bacterial and viral replication, and their effects on hosts and society. We will begin with the biology and life cycle of bacteria and viruses and how they infect their hosts. We will then look at how infectious agents affect their hosts and at how they spread. We will study several famous historical pandemics and look at their effects on society. We will then look at specific diseases in detail; these might include tuberculosis, HIV, malaria, smallpox, polio measles or others. We will then study how public health measures have been implemented to prevent infectious diseases and will study the role of sanitation, vaccination and supportive nursing care in reducing morbidity and mortality. Students will also keep a journal of events as they experience them during the current coronavirus pandemic.

In response to environmental and social crisis, theory and praxis figure significantly in the work of artists and artist collectives from around the globe whose practice manifests as socially engaged art (SEA) defined by Pablo Helguera; data/information reimagined as by Mona Hatoum and Trevor Paglen; or examinations of reconciliation and mass trauma in the work of Doris Salcedo and Kara Walker. In some cases, artworks engage with nature/culture by their placement in site-specific locations, through new modes of picturing, and/or through the appropriation of hypothetical scientific musings or emerging technologies (e.g., Ed Atkins, Ai Wei Wei, Adrian Piper, fictionalized genetic hybridization and subversion of surveillance tools). 
Many of the artists we will examine make use of new tools designed for industrial purpose, medical, agricultural, or scientific research. Others further participatory dialogues within anti-racist, de-colonizing, and queer-centered discursive practices. This work is inherently transdisciplinary and human ecological in disposition and character. Many of these producer-artists appropriate the role of “researcher” in order to bring attention to ecologies that human beings have disrupted or will disrupt.

We will start with first principles and carefully build toward key results, allowing students to see how relativity---one of the pillars of modern physics---was constructed and how it coheres as a mathematically consistent and experimentally verified theory. To gain a sense of the scientific, social, and material context in which the theory of relativity was developed, we will read Einstein's Clocks and Poincaré's Maps: Empires of Time, by Peter Galison.

ES,3089,NA,Tutorial: Geoheritage of coastal Maine,"Hall, Sarah","A “Geopark” is a designated area that features internationally significant sites of interest which highlight connections between geology and cultural heritage. Geoparks exist in over 40 countries, but currently there are none in the US. At present, a steering committee is in the planning stages of proposing one for our area of Coastal-Downeast Maine. Within this area there will be multiple “geosites”, chosen for their geology, cultural history, proximity to existing infrastructure, and potential for community engagement, will each feature interpretive signs and/or other materials enabling visitors to experience aspects of the geoheritage. To develop each geosite and educational materials, expertise is needed from multiple fields: geology, hydrology, geomorphology, human history, wildlife and plant biology, art history, and more. In this tutorial, students will work together with students in the Museum Practicum class to design one or more geosites for one of ~5 zones of coastal Maine stretching from Pemaquid Point in mid-coast Maine (southwest) to Cobscook Bay State Park near the Canadian border (northeast). Through individual meetings with instructors, small group meetings between students with and without instructors, and larger group meetings/presentations with instructors and visitors, students from both classes will be engaged with the overarching Geopark project throughout the term. The tutorial students will first research the local geology, biology, and human history and then synthesize and organize the information to highlight site-specific connections. The Museum Practicum students will consider site-specific characteristics and educational content suggested by the tutorial students to suggest options and prototypes for interpretive materials such as signs or online content. While each group of students will have separate topics to focus on, this will be very much a collaboration between the tutorial students and Museum Practicum students with one overarching objective to produce prototypes of the educational materials at geosites. Students in this tutorial will be assessed based on the quality and thoroughness of the topics researched and synthesized as well as their participation in the collaborative project with Museum Practicum students.

HS,4090,HS,Derrida and Questions of Difference II,"van Vliet, Netta","This class continues to engage with the questions addressed in the course Derrida and Questions of Difference. While the conceptual questions of that course and this one will overlap, the readings will be different. Readings will include texts by Jacques Derrida, along with texts by others who have engaged with his work. The online version of this course will include weekly synchronous online discussions and written exchanges on a shared google doc, in addition to the writing assignments referred to below.
 
Algerian Jewish philosopher, Jacques Derrida (1930-2004), one of the most widely translated French philosophers of the 20th century, developed a body of work often referred to as ""deconstruction."" Derrida’s oeuvre has influenced multiple fields and disciplines, including Literature, Anthropology, Philosophy, Postcolonial Studies, Psychoanalysis and Feminist Theory. This course will track some of the ways in which Derrida engaged with ideas of difference, through a focus on questions his work poses for understandings of the human. The class will engage with Derrida’s archive through reading some of his early work, including essays and interviews about the status of writing and speech, language, and philosophy, and then move through his later work, including his increasing focus on explicitly political topics such as the death penalty, the animal, sovereignty, and war. Although the texts we read will be primarily Derrida’s own writing, we will also read authors who respond to and build on Derrida’s thought. These may include Gayatri Spivak, Ranjana Khanna, Samir Haddad, Peggy Kamuf, and Michael Naas, as well as texts by those with whom Derrida was in dialogue, such as Sigmund Freud, Hélène Cixous, Michel Foucault, Sarah Kofman, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Karl Marx, Martin Heidegger and Emmanuel Levinas. As we move through Derrida’s texts and those informed by them, we will pay particular attention to questions about sexual difference, colonialism, the human, death in relation to life, value and representation. Students will be evaluated on participation in seminar discussions, weekly reading responses, a mid-term paper and final paper. Students are encouraged to contact the professor with any questions about the course and whether it is a good fit for them.

New development is often seen as undermining the sense of place and posing threats to environmental resources such as water quality or agricultural soils but alternative approaches may enhance and protect these same qualities. Working on real projects, the class provides assistance to community groups by providing information, analyzing the natural resources, cultural history, scenic quality and the built environment, and providing a range of options for them to consider.  Knowing how to effectively apply information available through GIS (Geographic Information Systems) is generally an integral part of land use planning. In this class students learn how to run ArcGIS software and to extract, analyze, and present pertinent information to inform land use decisions. Students who have already taken GIS are given more advanced assignments. The class will culminate in a presentation prepared for local community decision-makers. Given the online nature of this course the format of the final presentation is yet to be determined however it is dependent on everyone working together for a successful outcome.

We will critically examine a series of prominent models for understanding different ways artificial intelligence works and is transforming our societies and landscapes. We will critically examine and experiment with some key methods in futures studies to look at possible futures, assess their attractiveness and probability, and consider what steps might be taken to promote or prevent them. Methods considered will include, for instance: variations of extrapolation techniques, futures markets, scenario building, the Delphi process of consensus and futures imaging. A weekend workshop on futures imaging will be included as part of the course. Texts will include materials from Yuval Harari’s Homo Deus, Nick Bostrom’s Superintelligence, and a wide variety of short essays and website materials.  Assignments will include short homework exercises, two problem sets, and a series of short papers building to a final project on a topic of the student’s interest. Topics could include, for example, the impact of drones and cyber warfare on the national security state system, the role of automated and/or distance learning in transforming education, the use of AI to monitor and manipulate environmental systems or transformations of health care or food systems in light of AI when combined with nanotechnology, genetic modification or big data. Student work will be evaluated on the extent to which it demonstrates the development of skills for critically understanding, assessing and appropriately using the theories and methods covered in the course both in written projects as individuals and in collaborative discussions and workshop activities.

HS,4091,HS,Comparative Global Politics of Biol. Diversity & Clim. Chng,"Stabinsky, Doreen","Climate change and biological diversity are prominent issues on the global political and environmental governance agendas and in public environmental consciousness. Each issue will be the focus of a major United Nations summit in 2020. Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity will negotiate new post-2020 goals for halting biodiversity loss; parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change will see the launch of new commitments and a framework for action under the Paris Agreement. Meanwhile, public narratives of the escalating and intersecting dual “crises” of climate change and biodiversity loss provide a broader context for questioning the role and effectiveness of intergovernmental treaty regimes in addressing these crises.

This course will take a comparative and critical look at two multilateral treaty regimes: the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Students will study legal characteristics of each of the treaties, how problems are defined and addressed within each, mechanisms used for implementation, and the governmental and non-governmental actors involved in the work of treaty implementation. We will also look at how these two treaty bodies work together to address issues at the intersection of climate change and biological diversity. Finally, we will spend some time in the course reading a range of theoretical perspectives and pondering larger political and philosophical questions: Are our current intergovernmental institutions up to the challenge of addressing these immense planetary challenges? What are the potentials of and limits to intergovernmental spaces and collective action that might we discern? What role might there be for non-governmental actors and social movements to contest and construct more effective regimes? How does a study of these regimes help us imagine what a global politics of the terrestrial might look like?

Students will be evaluated based on their participation in class discussions, regular writing assignments reflecting on course readings, a presentation related to one of the treaty regimes, and a final synthetic essay that engages with topics covered during the term.

AD,5037,AD,Adaptation,"Baker, Jodi","This course will look closely at a small selection of plays adapted from other works. At its core this is a dramaturgical practice and methods course. Students will investigate impulses and processes for re-envisioning, re-working, re-purposing another’s text. We will read and discuss some theories of adaptation (mostly, but not exclusively, as they pertain to collaborative art making practices) as well as a sampling of contemporary criticism. A central goal of the course will be to better understand how the term adaptation is understood across disciplines and to fuel a complex discussion about what might make a theatrical adaptation feel relevant or effective in a given context. We will also look closely at moments in history that have instigated a serious 'looking back', spurring a collective creative impulse to re-visit and re-invent previously established works. One could argue that we are currently living in such a cultural moment. Please note: this course requires a significant reading load. Students will be required to close read/view all adapted texts, all original source materials and a variety of supporting texts (as described above).

From kata=down, strephein=turn, the Greek katastrephein meant ""under-turning"" in the ancient world. This course explores postulations regarding large- and small-scale calamitous events that seem to originate from below the surface of Earth. Our enquiry engages with legendary tales, historical records, material culture and scientific discourses that document attempts to explain the meaning and/or mechanism of such memorable episodes. What causes a mountain to eject ash and toxic gases? What infernal force creates lava flow? Why does the earth shake? Why do some natural waters cause harm? How do we understand that which we cannot see? Through case-studies informed by the literature of science, the arts and humanities, we will plumb the depths and limits of the human imagination.

Chappell goes on to argue that active optimism—the notion that problems can be solved if we act on them with critical knowledge—is precisely what is needed to end hunger. This course will embrace the practice of active optimism by engaging students in place-based efforts to address food systems issues at COA. In this advanced course, students will form project teams and work collaboratively to build on on-going campus food systems initiatives. During week one of the course, students will select project teams and work with the instructor to develop a reading list and schedule tailored to the groups' needs. Thereafter, class time will be dedicated to discussing readings, developing and peer-reviewing research plans and materials, presenting progress-reports, collecting and analyzing data, and facilitating community input and outreach activities.

Jahi Chappell quotes the Brazilian sociologist Herbert Jose ""Betinho"" de Souza, who said ""I'm not some stupid optimist. I'm an active optimist."" Chappell goes on to argue that active optimism—the notion that problems can be solved if we act on them with critical knowledge—is precisely what is needed to end hunger. This course will embrace the practice of active optimism by engaging students in place-based efforts to address food systems issues at COA. In this advanced course, students will form project teams and work collaboratively to build on on-going campus food systems initiatives. During week one of the course, students will select project teams and work with the instructor to develop a reading list and schedule tailored to the groups' needs. Thereafter, class time will be dedicated to discussing readings, developing and peer-reviewing research plans and materials, presenting progress-reports, collecting and analyzing data, and facilitating community input and outreach activities.

HS,4092,HS,The Measure of Our Lives: Toni Morrison Seminar,"Waldron, Karen","This course will be an intermediate/advanced seminar honoring and exploring the works of Toni Morrison (1931–2019), an African-American author who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1988 and numerous other notable awards. She was a giant of a public intellectual and contemporizing figure in American Literature; her works continue to inspire and transform readers and scholars of all identities although her primary purpose was to write for black people. As Morrison herself said, ""If there is a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, you must be the one to write it."" In writing she changed the literary landscape of the US. In particular, her poetics illustrate how African-American and especially African-American women authors express depths of meaning and experience absolutely central to any understanding of the complex culture and histories of the US. Another Morrison quote hints at the profundity of her own view of her life's work: ""We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives."" These two quotes provide a framework for the course, which seeks students interested in language and its power, literature and its insights, and the black female experience. Over the course of the term students will read through Morrison’s oeuvre of novels (The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Beloved, Jazz, Paradise, Love, A Mercy, Home, God Help the Child) as well as a number of her key essays and addresses (Playing in the Dark, The Source of Self-Regard), scholarly criticism, and responses to Morrison's 2019 passing. There may be some division of labor with the later novels (after Paradise), but the course is reading intensive. Students will also prepare frequent short written responses and a final project responding to Morrison in some way. Evaluation will be based on class participation, response papers, passage analysis, and the final Morrison project to be shared with the class.

HS,4093,HS,The Cider Project,"Little-Siebold, Todd","This year-long class will consist of a series of workshops, activities, and field trips over the course of the academic year. The course will be focused on learning all stages of hard cider production from evaluating fruit to fermentation all the way to the final bottling and label design. There will be additional background and contextual readings on the history and culture of cider. The goal will be to produce a hard cider ready in the following year. Working with cider makers from Maine and New England students will learn about how to identify the qualities in apples that make for excellent cider. They will then harvest fruit locally by foraging for high quality fruit to press into cider. With local cider makers students will then begin the fermentation process from monitoring the biochemistry of the juice through racking and secondary fermentation. Finally, in the spring the class will design the final labels, bottle the cider, and, in accordance with state law, evaluate the quality. At each stage participants will have workshops, readings, and projects that are part of the class. All students will be required to participate in a core series of workshops and activities, and then they will choose from among other activities as well. The course is appropriate for those interested in food studies, biochemistry, agricultural history, and botany, among other fields. No previous coursework required, but preference will be given to students who have some relevant academic background or personal experience. Evaluation will be based on engagement with and completion of core shared work, participation in workshops and field trips, and individual projects. There may be an optional two week trip to England to visit and learn from traditional cider makers there. This is a year-long course carrying a single credit.

ES,1079,NA,Remote Islands of the Atlantic,"Drennan, Matthew","There is something compelling about islands, especially remote oceanic specks of land hundreds of miles from a continent. How was the island created? What flora and fauna are found there? Are there humans?  How did they arrive and who discovered this oceanic speck? For over five hundred years explorers and settlers have engaged with the distant islands of the Atlantic for landmarks, for resources, for adventure, and, in some cases to create homes. This course will explore these questions, setting the human element in a geo-political context with reference to discovery and settlement. From the Falklands and South Georgia in the south, we’ll move northeast to the mid-Atlantic Ridge to examine Tristan da Cunha, St. Helena and Ascension. Each of these islands have played important roles in human history, and they also host some of the most remarkable populations of seabirds in the world. North of the equator, we’ll journey to Cape Verde, the Canaries, the Azores, on to Iceland, Greenland and Svalbard. The role of these islands in global conservation and the growth of eco-tourism will be examined. Once we have familiarized ourselves with aspects of remote island ecology and history, we will use this lens to briefly examine more familiar coastal islands such as Manhattan or the British isles. The class will be taught in a lecture and discussion format and students will be assessed on the basis of two papers, one at midterm, and one as a final,  and occasional quizzes.

What constitutes a perfect or ideal society? Or, if no such place is possible, what makes for a well-functioning society? Likewise, what constitutes a terrible society? What kind of places and spaces do we want to avoid? These are important questions for human ecologists to ask as we seek to improve our relationships with our natural, social, and technological environments. To explore questions of ideal and flawed places, this course studies the concepts of utopia and dystopia across a range of philosophical, political, and literary writings. Although we will focus our attention on theoretical literature, we will read several novels and short stories, and students will present research on a work of utopian or dystopian fiction.

Additional course questions include: What motivates us to envision utopias and dystopias? Does political philosophy require a utopian vision? What do utopias and dystopias tell us about social fears, anxieties, and hopes? Course readings will focus on classical Greek thought, Enlightenment thought, political theory, and critical theory. Texts may include Plato’s Republic, Thomas More’s Utopia, Marx and Engels’ Communist Manifesto, William Godwin’s Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, Sigmund Freud’s Civilization and Its Discontents, Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland, Octavia Butler’s Blood Child, Ursula K. LaGuin’s The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas, Hannah Arendt’s The Origins of Totalitarianism, George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, and selections form The Utopian Reader by Gregory Claeys and Lyman Tower Sargent.

AD,3073,NA,Land Studio,"Hutton, Eamonn","Human resilience is inextricably linked to natural and engineered landscapes. This course asks students to examine our relationship to these terrains, and apply their learning through the design of a specific site. This course is fundamentally a landscape architecture studio with a focus on resilience and self-sufficiency at various scales and across multiple systems (water, food, shelter). Each student will select a local site, and generate a land-based strategy to support human subsistence. Throughout the course, weekly lectures will explore the traditional, contemporary, and emergent methods of shaping productive and performative landscapes. Students will be evaluated based on three milestone assignments - including the development of a final site model - as well as engagement with the course materials through discussion.

MD,1021,NA,Seeing Ecology through Arts Practice,"Rock, Jennifer","This course is an experiment in seeing ecology through hands-on arts practice. We examine how a combined arts and science approach (observation, questioning, rendering, hypothesising…) leads to reflective practice in understanding ecological interaction and process. From visualising connectivity to sensory pattern recognition, we explore how arts practice can help us formulate (and begin to answer) scientific questions. The course will have multiple weekly place-based field components in combination with synchronous and asynchronous online teaching.

Evaluation will be based on three components: (1) A field notebook (combined sketchbook, observation and practice journal etc) which will serve to document your process of inquiry, including observation and description (at both micro and macro level), ""questions for science"" derived from arts-based inquiry, and weekly field assignments. As a reflective journal, it will also critically examine your expectations, intentions, and observations of process and outcome. In addition to sketching, other creative methods of observation will be used such as frottage (rubbings), monoprint, found material collage, as well as words (e.g. haiku). (2) Reflective interaction and discussion of assigned readings (from historic (e.g. Goethe) to contemporary (e.g. Gemma Anderson)). (3) A final project that will consolidate/montage a particular vein of observation and questioning from your observation of ecological interactions (e.g. an aspect of ecology, environmental physiology or human ecology). The final project will be presented in a format for sharing with an external audience, and may include video, animation, sound recordings, sculpture, painting and other media.

HS,2105,W,Writing for Social Change,"Cass, Blake","Designed to meet the first-year writing requirement, this course gives students the opportunity to explore rhetorical strategies of writing for social change. Beginning with writing that emerged in the wake of George Floyd's death, we will read and analyze articles and essays that deal with a range of contemporary social issues.

By examining the principles of exposition and argumentation, students will develop their analytical skills. Students should expect to spend a significant amount of time on sentence-level construction. Grammar and syntax are powerful tools that can be used to craft persuasive, moving arguments. Grammar and syntax can also be used to mislead and manipulate an audience. Understanding grammar and syntax is essential for reading and writing well. But whose grammar and syntax are we talking about when we say ""writing well""? Standard American English or Edited American English is the written language taught in most American schools and used in much of the media that we consume. But it is not the only English available to us. By de-penalizing and making space for ""nondominant Englishes"" (Asao B. Inoue), we will explore how ""language functions within and from various cultural perspectives"" (Vershawn Ashanti Young). By practicing the art of code-meshing, students will explore ""the connection between language and identity"" (Neisha-Anne S. Green) and develop ""critical awareness of choices that are rhetorically more effective"" (Suresh Canagajah).

Classes will focus on both writing activities that teach students to explore and strengthen their prose, and discussion and analysis of the works we read. Two short academic papers will help students develop a writing process that works for them. Additionally, students will engage in activist writing throughout the term, allowing them to put the writing strategies they have learned into action. The culmination of the term will be a research project on a social issue of their choosing that will test their ability to put rhetorical strategies to effective use.

Evaluation is based on engagement in class discussions and successful completion of all writing assignments (weekly activist writing, two analytical papers, and a final writing project).

MD,1022,NA,Working the Sea,"Anderson, John","For much of the past 5000 years the sea has played a major role in a broad variety of human cultures, histories, arts, and economies.  Sea-faring peoples have developed a rich lore and technology that allows them to both survive and even thrive in an often hostile element. This course will mix practical, hands-on learning of aspects of seamanship with a survey of fiction and non-fiction that address maritime themes.  During the early part of the term we will concentrate on aspects of small-boat handling, using the College’s inflatables, rowing boats, and the larger research vessels, Osprey and Laughing Gull.  Students will learn how to launch and land small-craft from docks and beaches, basic rowing skills and use of an outboard motor. They will learn essential knots useful aboard ship and on the dock, how to lay out a course using a chart and compass, use of GPS and depth sounders, basic Rules of the Road, and elements of celestial navigation.  During some lab periods we will go on short voyages in the general area of Frenchman Bay. As the term proceeds and weather worsens, we will turn to an increasingly greater literary component, reading accounts of famous voyages and local fishermen, discoveries, battles, legends and poetry.  Possible texts include, but are not limited to: Working the Sea by Wendell Seavey, Master and Commander by Patrick O’ Brian, Maiden Voyage by Tania Aebi, The Perfect Storm by Sebastian Junger, In the Heart of The Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick, Longitude by Dava Sobel, Slave Ship: A Human History by Marcus Rediker, Kon Tiki by Thor Heyerdahl, We Didn’t Mean to Go To Sea by Arthur Ransome as well as excerpts from The Greenlanders’ Saga, Moby Dick, The Old Man and the Sea, The Voyage of the Beagle, and Two Years Before the Mast.

ES,2043,NA,Interpreting Maine's Changing Landscape,"Hamley, Kit","This course will examine the last 20,000 years of Maine’s climate and human history. 20,000 years ago Maine was completely covered by the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) rendering the landscape uninhabitable to plants and animals alike. Shortly following the recession of the LIS, humans entered the scene and for thousands of years modified the landscape to better suit their needs. With the arrival of European colonizers came great cultural and biological upheaval: the Great Dying of America’s indigenous populations, introductions of invasive species, and novel agricultural practices. Through the lens of paleoecology, we will explore how Maine’s biological, geological, and cultural landscapes have responded to perturbations through time.

This course explores these changes within a place-based experience on a farm on Marsh Stream in Monroe, Maine. Topics for this course include past environmental change and ecological responses in species, populations, and ecosystem processes; common methods and proxies in paleoecological analyses; ecological principles applied to past organisms; paleohuman influences on the landscape; impacts of European colonization and the pristine myth; and the role of paleoecology in modern conservation efforts.

The class will include weekly lectures, discussion sections, and labs. Labs will include collecting a sediment core, examining different proxies from that core (ie. charcoal, macrofossils, sediment type), identifying evidence of glaciation, examining forest succession, and mapping the historic agricultural landscape. Students will generate and analyze data for a collaborative original research paper and results will be written up in the form of a manuscript for publication.

Students will be evaluated based on discussion leadership for two classes, a lab/field notebook and research updates (including group presentations), a collaborative, publishable-quality manuscript of all research findings, and a final outreach project to share the findings of the semester long study with the broader COA community.

ES,1080,NA,Ornithology,"MacDonald, Richard","The study of ornithology is as old as human society itself.  Birds are particularly conspicuous elements of our world, and figure prominently in our art, religious symbolism, mythology, scientific endeavors and even sport.  Birds appear in European paleolithic cave paintings from 14,000 years ago, domesticated fowl are known from India circa 3000 BC, and ancient scholars such as Aristotle and Pliny the Elder devoted considerable time to ornithological observations.  In this century great strides have been made in the study of population biology and ecology, navigation and migration, and human induced ecological change (sometimes called human ecology), all through the study of birds. This class introduces the student to the ornithological world by using both scientific literature and direct field observation.  Systematics and physiology will be reviewed, but much of our effort will concentrate on reproductive ecology, behavior and the environment, and population dynamics.  There will be a strong emphasis on field observation - learning how to look at birds and their behavior in order to perhaps make larger observations about their environment.

MD,1024,NA,Life With Principle,"Epstein, Katherine","Over 150 years ago, Henry David Thoreau grappled with the question of how to live a principled and meaningful life in his essay ""Life Without Principle."" This course will revisit this ever-pressing question in our current age. We will examine what it means to live a life with principle, and how to go about living one given the current situation in the world. We will read and discuss foundational and cutting-edge findings of social psychology to better understand how the human mind works and what cognitive quirks lead us to think and behave as we do. We will discuss various aspects of the global situation in 2020, including but not limited to ecological destruction, technology, inequality, power dynamics, and the interactions between these subjects. Throughout, we will engage with the central question of how to define and live a principled life. We will read accounts of various people who have also grappled with this question and discuss their experiences as well as our own.

Students will be evaluated based on their level of engagement with the course material, through class discussions and written reflections. A final project with some element of creativity and freedom will allow them to express their thoughts and ideas at the end of the semester. Since the idea of community is closely related to the course content, and the students and faculty will be living and studying in a unique setting, this course will be an excellent venue to critically engage with the question of how to be a supportive and productive community member.

Artists have utilized motion pictures as a studio-based practice and as an extension of performance, painting, writing, drawing, and the body.  Whether the results are abstract, experimental, essay, found footage or diary, these works can be highly independent, creative works of art.  In this course, students will follow prompts and assignments to make short works exploring some of these possibilities.  Students will read critical essays and artists’ statements addressing film as art, and study related films and videos. Students will be asked to research and present on a film/video artist. Students will be evaluated based on the completion of assignments and participation in discussions and peer critiques.

Our exploration of storytelling, as a communicative practice and relational performance with multiple applications in daily life; whether providing testimony and witnessing, prompting topical discourse within the community, or honoring a person or tradition through living thought, it is the storyteller’s intentions that guide our methods of preparing for and evaluating a given performance within a given context. The course progresses as a practice of observing stories daily, and through preparation of three storytelling performance projects, combined with listening activities, readings, discussion, research/interview assignments and performance exercises. Evaluation will be based on participation and experimentation in class activities respective to each story project, and implementation of techniques used to address ‘story time,’ the transfer of experience from tellers to listeners.

The intersection of these practices with fields such as cognitive and affective neuroscience, cognitive and developmental psychology, integrative medicine, comparative religion, education, and sustainability science examine the impacts on mental and physical health, socio-emotional learning, and a less consumption-driven future. This tutorial will survey those practices supported by evidence from recent research. The application of these practices have similarly flourished in mindfulness-based interventions and programs in therapeutic settings and schooling from early childhood to adult education and professional programs including counseling, medicine, law, social work, and teacher education. Pedagogical approaches apply to classroom contexts as well as informal settings such as environmental education and include diverse approaches such as collaborative poetry and contemplative photography. This tutorial engages students in a review of the research literature in parallel with micro-phenomenological inquiry through sustained individual or group practice with one or two practices and journaling. Students will also spend a substantial portion of the tutorial engaging in a variety of contemplative practices with area teachers while working on research or education projects.

The concepts will be relevant to all types of museums and informal learning environments, as well as to students interested in applying the ideas in school environments. As we investigate learning in museums, we will consider some of the major debates in the field, and develop our personal educational philosophies. We will base our classwork on the widely read Learning from Museums (Falk & Dierking), and we will consider links to educational philosophers including Dewey, Piaget, and Vygotsky, as well as museum research and evaluation studies. We will also examine a number of current issues in the field including family learning, the role of interactivity, issues of authority, voice and representation, and the potential of emerging technologies including remote learning, asynchronous interpretation, and Augmented Reality. Simultaneously, we will apply this theory to a practical project: helping to inform the early stage planning of a future museum project. For this project, we will conduct background educational research and a front-end evaluation study. Based on the results we will start to envision possible interpretive approaches consistent with our developing educational philosophy and our understanding of the potential visitors. The course will stress the use of the design process: integrating iterative prototyping and evaluation to ensure we are developing approaches that will be engaging and meaningful.

HS,1085,NA,Introduction to Sexual Health,"Magnuson, Madalynne","This multi-disciplinary course will explore a breadth of human sexuality topics drawing from public health theories, prevention education practices, feminist scholarship, and queer activism. Prevention education promotes the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary for a sexually healthy population and seeks to prevent the spread of disease and violence. In addition to educating individuals in how to engage in health promoting behaviors, effective prevention education takes into consideration cultures that inhibit or facilitate health. Prevention education supports policies, practices, and norms that create an environment where all populations can thrive.
The World Health Organization defines sexual health as, “a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences free from coercion, discrimination and violence…” With this definition in mind we will discuss topics including sexual health and reproduction, sexual identity, intimacy, sensuality, and sexualization. Sources of discussion may include the social-ecological model of health, theories from twentieth century sex researchers such as William Masters and Virginia Johnson, tactics of sexual health activists such as ACT UP, feminist writers such as Audre Lorde, and web-based sex education platforms such as Afrosexology and Amaze. From discussions students can expect to examine their personal attitudes, gain up-to-date knowledge and resources, and grow their skills for promoting sexual health in their lives and communities.

HS,4095,NA,Sacred Sounds: The Significance of Music in Mesoamerica,"Manzanilla Haas, Raúl E.","Throughout history, music has played an important role in various cultures and in the case of Mesoamerica it was no different, since it is known that since pre-Columbian times, various peoples of what is now Mexico had a great variety of musical instruments that accompanied their religious life, festivities and dances. With the passage of time and from the conquest, music began to take on different nuances and began to diversify thanks to the incursion of a variety of new musical instruments that arrived with the Spanish as well as the new rhythms contributed by the African population that arrived during the colonization and that today form an important part of the culture of our Afro-Mexican communities, thus enriching our ethnic diversity and sound. Today Mesoamerican cultures continue to express their worldview through their sacred music, accompanying songs and dances with melodies that carry an inevitable syncretism and musical reinterpretation, thus achieving an extension of their sound culture through time. For this reason, this course aims for the student to have an approach to the main musical manifestations of Mexico, highlighting its cultural importance for current communities, as well as knowing the contemporary rhythms that in some way influence the construction of their cultural identity and ethnic recognition through music.  The course is designed as an immersive experience  in Spanish language and Latin American culture to help further the proficiency of those students who already have an intermediate, advanced or native level fluency in the language. All aspects of the course, including submitted assignments, will be conducted in Spanish. For each session, the student will have to carry out short investigations and readings related to the topics explored in student led discussions. Said readings will be accompanied by audio and / or audiovisual material that they should listen to and / or watch before each session.

HS,3101,HS,"Alienation, Freedom, Difference","van Vliet, Netta","This course is organized around the writings of Frantz Fanon. Fanon, an anticolonial thinker, psychiatrist, and playwright, born in French-ruled Martinique in 1925, is best known for his anticolonial writings, including Black Skin, White Masks, and The Wretched of the Earth. Fanon’s influence on postcolonial studies and anticolonial struggle is also informed by his work in psychoanalysis. Alienation and Freedom (2018), which gathers together previously unpublished writings by Fanon, including plays, accounts from his work in the Blida psychiatric clinic in Algeria, and his explicitly political writings, will serve as a central text for the course. There and elsewhere, Fanon staged philosophical, anthropological, economic and literary encounters between France and its colonies, most specifically Algeria and Martinique, and more broadly between Europe and its others, and posed questions about the effects of the structures through which colonialism functioned - questions that continue to be relevant for postcolonial conditions today. Through a consideration of Fanon’s writings and those who have engaged with them, we will examine concepts of alienation, freedom, violence and difference in terms of postcolonial conditions and contemporary questions about racism and structural inequities. Over the term, we will read excerpts from Alienation and Freedom, along with other texts by Fanon and by those who informed his thinking and by those who have been informed by it, likely including Aimé Césaire, Octave Mannoni, Steve Biko, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Albert Memmi, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Stefania Pandolfo, Omnia El Shakry, Michael Taussig, Homi Bhabha, Gayatri Spivak and Ranjana Khanna.

HS,1087,NA,American Detective Literature,"Cass, Blake","Although there are many intriguing subgenres of detective fiction, this course will focus on the evolution of the figure of the American private investigator. We will explore how the PI subgenre presents (and possibly critiques and challenges) individualism, concepts of masculinity and femininity, and, of course, the persistence of the femme fatale. By reading texts from a diverse range of authors starting from the 1840s to the present, we will take a close look at how/whether attitudes toward race, sex, gender, and class have shifted over time. Works may include Poe’s “The Purloined Letter,” Hammett’s Red Harvest, Chandler’s The Big Sleep, MacDonald’s The Way Some People Die, Paretsky’s Indemnity Only, Mosley’s Devil in a Blue Dress, Wesley’s When Death Comes Stealing, Garcia-Aguilera’s Bloody Waters, and Gran’s Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead. Students can expect to read theory to enhance their understanding of the detective genre and attend/view weekly screenings of films such as The Thin Man and Night Moves and episodes of TV shows such as The Rockford Files, Magnum P.I., Moonlighting, and Veronica Mars.

The first seven weeks of the course will be dedicated to literary analysis. Students will produce two major papers and write weekly reading responses. There will be a strong emphasis on pre-writing, and each major paper will go through peer revision. The last three weeks will be devoted to the craft of fiction writing, and students will compose their own short pieces of detective fiction.

Evaluation will be based on a labor-based grading system indebted to the work of Asao B. Inoue. As Inoue writes, “How much labor you do is more important to your learning and growth as a reader and writer than the quality of your writing.”

HS,1089,NA,Worlds Beyond the Human: Multispecies Justice,"Fairbank, Chelsea","This course will explore the emergent discourses concerned with multispecies justice and the recognition of more-than-human communities. Students will engage with different approaches to these modes of environmental thinking, research, and writing in order to consider worlds beyond the human. This approach examines how the distinctions between nature/culture and human/nonhuman came into being and considers what kind of life is constituted, held accountable, and conserved. Amidst the rapid, yet often obscured, ecological changes happening around the globe, how are cultural, legal, and environmental justice narratives emerging which de-center the human and acknowledge the ‘rights of nature’? Importantly, what are the potential limits to a multispecies or rights framework in a world where entire mountaintops are removed to continue legacies of extractive capitalism? Students will engage with literature and thinkers across a spectrum of approaches to more-than-human ethics including: new materialism, posthumanism, the growing global movement towards granting legal personhood for non-humans, and the cultures advocating for reciprocal rights and responsibilities to more-than-human communities. Course content will extend analysis beyond a multispecies and/or rights framework towards considering the agencies, sovereignties, and analytics of other-than-humans such as water, geologic formations, and even fungi. Overarchingly, the course will prompt students to articulate and write on the potentials of more-than-human ethics to assist equity outcomes for ecological and social communities during the Anthropocene. Assignments will include regular participation in class discussion, responses to colleagues’ written posts, a series of short reflective essays, and a final project based on each student’s own research interests, as it pertains to course content. Particular emphasis throughout the course will encourage students to demonstrate critical reading, speaking, and writing through synthesis of course content and class discussions.

HS,2109,HS,"Rethinking the Canon: Self, Others, and Philosophy","Lakey, Heather","How do ""philosophies born of struggle"" (Leonard Harris) change, disrupt, and advance the discipline of philosophy? Academic philosophers have historically studied a select group of thinkers, most of whom are white men from Europe. European philosophers offer wonderfully rich arguments, but like all perspectives, theirs are partial and limited. To explore foundational philosophical questions, this course will read canonical European philosophers alongside scholars who engage with this canon from a diverse set of cultural, political, and historical contexts, such as indigenous studies, Africana philosophy, Latin American philosophy, postcolonial studies, and feminist theory. Along the way, we will read essays that analyze the concept of “the canon,” and we will consider how different theoretical interventions advance the discipline of philosophy.

To rethink the canon, this course will center on four philosophical questions: 1) What is the self or subjectivity? 2) What is the relationship between self and other? 3) What makes someone a good or virtuous person? 4) How do different linguistic forms (propositional, poetic, narrative) shape our thinking about reality and relationships? For each set of questions, we will pair texts from different historical and cultural contexts. Possible philosophers include Gloria Anzaldúa, Charles Mills, W.E.B Du Bois, Henry Odera Oruka, Kwasi Wiredu, Ofelia Schutte, René Descartes, Kris Sealey, Alain LeRoy Locke, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Frantz Fanon, Maria Lugones, Plato, John Locke, Brian Yazzie Burkhart, Friedrich Nietzsche, Simone de Beauvoir, Winona LaDuke, Judith Butler, Kwame Gyekye, Jean Paul Sartre, Oyèrónké Oyèwùmí, and Kathryn Sophia Belle.

In this course, students will be introduced to a number of concepts, contexts, and methods from these fields that deal with the nexus of language and education within the processes of transnational migration. They will read texts from these fields by scholars such as Suresh Canagarajah and Lisa Patel. In particular, this course will highlight the unique challenges, as well as affordances, at and across borders by featuring narratives from books, podcasts, short films, documentaries and/or guest speakers. These narratives will portray the educational and lived experiences of transnational individuals with different educational backgrounds and trajectories, individuals such as the exchange students, international students, students with immigrant or refugee backgrounds, students with families of migrant labor, undocumented students, etc. While trying gain a broader and deeper understanding of the experiences of transnational learners, students in this course will apply what they learn in a number of activities, such as class discussions and presentations, book/film reviews, interviews, project proposals targeting community partners that serve transnational learners, final projects involving narrative, arts-based, and/or (auto)ethnographic research methods.

ES,4058,ES,Applied Amphibian Biology,"Ressel, Stephen","Most amphibians are small vertebrates that require moist microhabitats and/or unrestricted access to fresh water to sustain their populations. Despite their diminutive size, need for moisture, and cryptic habits, the 6000+ species of extant amphibians are found on all continents except Antarctica and are extremely diverse in their morphology, ecology, and behavior. Amphibian diversity peaks in tropical regions but salamanders are thought to be the numerically dominant vertebrate species in mature forest habitats of the eastern US. Because their combined numbers represent a significant amount of living biomass, amphibians have been used as crucial bio-indicators to assess the ecological health of natural communities. Worldwide declines in anuran populations are well documented, with a multitude of causes for these declines being implicated depending on species and locale.

Applied Amphibian Biology is a field- and discussion-based course that engages students in a series of on-going projects which address the intersection of amphibian biology and conservation biology on Mount Desert Island. Students will collect original data in the field, analyze and interpret trends in the data, and write up their findings for future dissemination at local and/or regional conferences. Readings will be drawn from book chapters, the primary literature, and web sources that archive PDF documents germane to this course. The sequence and tempo of work in this course are heavily weather dependent, requiring students to conduct research at night, often with little notice beforehand.

ES,2045,NA,Applied Data Science,"Shank, Kyle S","There isn’t really much consensus on what Data Science actually is. Some argue that it’s a nascent interdisciplinary field that encompasses elements of computer science, applied statistics, and data visualization. Others insist that it’s a “fourth paradigm” of science: empirical, theoretical, computational, and now “data-driven”. Regardless of what it is, what may be most important is to understand what Data Science does and what you can learn to do with it!

This course will be both a broad overview of how Data Science is done in the “real world” with a specific focus on learning applications of practical Data Science skills. This would be a great class for those interested in an introductory exploration of Data Science as a primary area of focus as well as those looking to add a degree of technical expertise with data to pre-existing work and interests. We’ll be focusing on four major areas of application: (1) properly building data-driven questions and hypotheses; (2) obtaining, organizing, and transforming data; (3) exploratory data analysis and pattern recognition; and, as time permits, (4) data visualization and communication. Leaving this class,  students will be able to immediately apply these concepts to a broad array of interests. For example: students should be able to generate hypotheses from disparate data sources (such as minutes from ACM), obtain and transform data from websites (like accessing the U.S. Census Bureau API), explore and analyze data to discover patterns (such as through spatial biological data sets), and visualize such data for easy communication to peers and laypersons. 

Classes will be taught as a mix of live coding exercises, lectures, and group discussions. No prior programming experience is required - we’re going to be learning to use the R programming language in this course! - but a familiarity with computers and data will be helpful. Students will need to use either their personal laptop or a COA loaner laptop for class and programming exercises. Evaluation will be through class participation and discussion, several data investigation exercises, and a final project. The data investigations will take the form of written analyses of several well-known data sets as well as investigations of synthetic ones created specifically for the course. The final project will take the form of an oral presentation of an analysis. This can be either done in a group or as an individual and may be of any topic of sufficient interest to the student(s) involved.

Particular emphasis is given to field and laboratory methods of identification including field recognition of important genera, micro-habitat preferences of selected species, collection techniques, use of keys, methods of identification, and proper curation.  Major goals of the course are to have students develop the “hands on” skills and the confidence necessary to identify lichens to the species level. The class will meet twice a week, three hours each meeting, with one hour devoted to lecture, two hours to lab. An all-day Saturday field trip is planned at the beginning of the term to introduce students to the diversity of microhabitats in which lichens are found, proper collection techniques, writing brief, accurate field notes, and starting their personal collections. In addition, one or more Saturday morning help sessions will be provided if needed to help students get started on their personal collections. The course grade will be based on: (a) class participation (10%);  (b) demonstrated capacity for doing independent work (20%); (c) bi-weekly quizzes (40%); and (d) a student final project consisting of a properly identified and curated collection of 15 species of lichens, excluding taxa previously identified in class as part of group keying exercises or needing the assistance of the instructor (30%). The final project must include a minimum of seven crustose lichens.  Bonus course credit will be given for any new MDI, county, or state records (5%).

AD,1057,NA,Performance and Ecology: What Can Theater Do?,"Mendez, Khristian E","Using Carl Lavery's question for the performing arts as a starting point, this course investigates live performance’s historical and contemporary engagement with ecological concerns. Our course will begin by establishing a common language for discussing theatre. We will then explore a range of international performance, while learning about the contexts (environmental, cultural, and institutional) that influence their development, production and reception. We will focus our attention on the interaction between narrative, embodied, and material elements within these performances while reading sections from texts in literary ecocriticism, performance studies, theatre history, environmental history, and anthropology. If in-person, there will be one fieldtrip mid-semester. Key questions will include: how might the body of a performer complicate the distinction between “environment” and “society”? What are the means by which we can categorize a play or a production as “ecological”? What are the specific affective narratives embedded within environmentalist discourse and how might performance interrupt or complicate those? What might have performance already done for the environment? Course goals are to refine our skill set for analyzing the relationship between scientific facts and narrative, a better sense of the impact that live performance can have on the various communities where it takes place, and a sharper framework for engaging an audience with questions regarding the “natural” world. Major works will likely include: Manuela Infante’s Estado Vegetal; the Rude Mechanicals’ Not Every Mountain; Rolling Ryot’s Rainforest Reverb; Anne Washburn’s Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play; Chantal Bilodeau’s Sila; Grupo Sotzil’s Uk’u’x Ulew; William Shakespeare’s The Tempest and The Winter’s Tale; Adam R. Burnett’s Mammoth: A De-extinction Love Story; Animal Facts Club’s Gulf of Maine; Art At Work MAINEUSA’s Blessing of the Creatures; Shawna Dempsey & Lorri Millan’s Lesbian National Parks and Services.

ES,3093,NA,Plants and the Urban Environment,"Lawlor, Josie","The proportion of people living in cities is increasing worldwide. As we hasten to make our cities and towns sustainable in the face of climate change, more livable and healthy for the world’s population, we will need to integrate plants more intelligently into our built environments. Green roofs, rain gardens, and bioswales are successful examples of highly designed plant communities that serve multiple functions in the built environment. Yet, generally, urban landscapes present challenging and extreme living conditions for many plants.

In this botany course we examine plant adaptation to extreme environments. What do alpine plants have in common with plants in a desert, or beside a highway? What mechanisms and morphologies enable plants to withstand heat, drought or water loss? With awareness that plants are the foundation of our own habitat, we explore these questions through lectures, lab sessions, and field trips to local sites.
This course is intended for students with previous botany coursework who want to deepen their appreciation of plants and their adaptations.  Evaluations are based on weekly quizzes, an exam, a field/lab notebook, and class participation.

This course will prepare you to thoughtfully analyze your audience, research and organize relevant information, and deliver the critically important, well-prepared presentation that you’re capable of.  Along the way we will be guided by, and critically analyze, three varied and sometimes contradictory premises: that it’s imperative to master the art of formal, standard presentation/speech delivery, that it’s equally important to respect and refine your own unique, authentic voice and speech communication style, and that important change happens when we both listen carefully and speak up loudly.  This class will be conducted as a workshop with an emphasis on students producing increasingly advanced speeches for public performance and/or consumption. Students will complete three graded, “formal” presentations  while also considering additional creative approaches and formats for  public communication.  Students will work with a variety of short texts and videos to generate new ideas and helpful public speaking habits.  The real benefits of this course come from the positive, supportive, environment in which students can practice new public speaking skills and learn from each other.  This class emphasizes a fun, dynamic, “hands-on” approach to constructing speeches.  Students who feel that they are less proficient in the area of public communication should not be worried that this would somehow disadvantage them in terms of their overall evaluation.  All students, regardless of their levels of comfort, experience, or and English-proficiency are encouraged to consider this course.  This workshop is designed to help you improve your public presentation skills regardless of whether you are a complete novice to public speaking, or already have many years of practice. Your final evaluation for the course will be based on your engagement with the process, not on some objective standard of who gave the best speeches.

MD,1027,NA,Primitive Skills for the 21st Century,"Jenei, Nicholas Paul","Primitive skills are the knowledge, practices, and simple tools unique to a specific bio-region that allowed the ancestors of modern humans to thrive in every corner of the earth without agriculture or industry.  Knowledge of these primitive, or “primary,” skills  have been passed down and honed through countless generations, and are still practiced today as a way of connecting with our deep past, the natural world, and a simpler, more intentional way of life. Through this course you will learn Maine-based primitive skills at COA's Peggy Rockefeller bush-camp, explore primitive skills as a global movement and delve into its philosophical foundations, and track the nature of your evolving relationship with, well, nature. Together we will learn a suite of essential bushcraft skills that are part of a millennia old living tradition of how to travel through and thrive in Maine's eco-regions and seasons.  Some of the core survival skills covered include fire making, shelter building, foraging/hydration, and axe and knife work.  But learning how to thrive in the Maine woods requires a very diverse set of knowledge and you will be introduced to: practical botany, cordage and knots, canoeing, animal tracking, traditional craft, navigation, mental preparedness, medicinal plants, first aid, and more. We will explore these topics through readings, videos, and practicum experiences.  The driving question of our inquiry is to explore, and experience, the value that primitive skills bring to contemporary life. This class will have one 1.5 hour classroom session and one 3 hour field session per week. Additionally there will be 2 weekend field trips (dates to be determined by the class).  Student evaluation  will be based on practicum skill assessments, self-reflection through journaling, and an individual research project. This class is open to all students regardless of their previous background or experience with primitive or outdoor skills. However, students will be expected to engage in moderately strenuous physical activity, including: hikes up to 4 miles, chopping and carrying wood, building structures out of small trees weighing up to 50lbs.  Anyone with an interest in primitive skills, outdoor survival, place-based education, or experiential learning would benefit from the class.

It will consider the nature of intelligence in its many forms in humans and nature and examine how these and other forms of intelligence may be coded into emerging AI technologies or developed through various forms of machine learning, evolutionary programming, et cetera. Sample topics include roles of AI in education, health, agriculture, transportation, policing, military, scientific research, the arts, spiritual traditions, religions, government, language translation, and bridging relations between different cultures.

Goals are to develop: understandings of the basic programming principles, research and development strategies and underlying philosophical assumptions guiding development in such technologies; abilities to use interdisciplinary, problem centered approaches to understand complicated vs. “wicked” problems associated with rapid technological change and key approaches to dealing with them; collaborative skills for problem-centered studies and programming projects in AI in areas of student interest; and meta-cognitive abilities to learn these kinds of material in groups as well as on your own.

Students pursue term projects individually or collaboratively which may include; futures studies use of methods of historical and/or social science research to investigate some emerging, AI-related social or environmental concern; a computer programming project that solves a practical problem, is conducive to artistic expression, performs scientific analysis of quantitative data, or demonstrates an established or experimental feature of an Machine Learning or otherwise AI system; or a philosophical and/or theoretical critical analysis of underlying concepts, values or assumptions that are at stake in the emerging AI technologies.

Readings will include classic texts in AI theory, philosophy, and futures studies as well as selections from standard texts on AI programming like that of Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. We will also use podcasts, films, and other media to pursue key topics and trends. There will be a series of short programming activities to study basic principles and try modelling aspects of more complicated and/or complex systems. These will be done, at least initially, in block coding accessible to students without previous programming experience. We will examine the ways in which they can be coded in Python and students familiar with that or other languages will be able to pursue homework and final project work in whatever language they may prefer.

Class sessions and lab will vary in format from extended discussion of texts and problems to supplementary lecture, visiting speakers, collaborative coding activities and extended project work. The class as a group will develop at least one major hackathon style project as a way of exploring key issues and developing key skills.

Evaluation will be based on the extent to which students demonstrate in homework, class participation and term projects that they have advanced in each of the four main goals for the course.

The texts will include those from the US and beyond, in an attempt to sample the wide range of fabulous prose authors (primarily novelists and essayists) that speak from and about the experiences of a significant segment of the world’s population. Similarities and differences between prose styles and narrative focus will allow us to probe aesthetic and linguistic as well as cultural and historical phenomena and contexts. While the emphasis will be on works written since 2000, we will begin the term by reading a few 20th century authors who paved the way for the artistry which was to follow — choosing among writers such as Ann Petry, Gwendolyn Brooks, Octavia Butler and James Baldwin from the US and Chinua Achebe, Bessie Head, and Ama Ata Aidoo from the African continent. Earlier selections will set us up with questions about the fiction and prose literary articulation coming from both post-slavery and post-colonial contexts. The remainder of the term we will read 21st century works by authors such as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichi, Colson Whitehead, Ta-nehisi Coates, Yaa Gyasi, Zadie Smith, Jessmyn Ward, and Nnedi Okorafor. Students will be evaluated on class participation, shared discussion leading responsibilities, and written work. Each student will choose one of three options for written work: four 2-3 page critical analyses; two 5-7 page studies of a particular work or theme; or a 12-15 page extended analysis of one or two works or authors.

AD,3077,AD,Black Atlantic Music,"Henderson, Jonathan","In Black Atlantic Music students will work to understand how histories of slavery, colonialism, diasporic imagination, and networks of cultural exchange form the basis for popular music in the African diaspora. Tracing musical and political histories through a series of case studies routed throughout the diaspora, this course aims to develop a theory of “the Black Atlantic” as a sonic geography. After establishing a foundation in the key historical forces leading to the creation of the African diaspora, students will explore case studies related to the development of local and transnational musical styles from salsa to hip-hop, funk, reggae and more. We will explore the intersecting work of artists (such as Janelle Monae, Angélique Kidjo, Fela Kuti, Lee “Scratch” Perry, and Bob Marley) and scholars (such as Paul Gilroy, Angela Davis, Amiri Baraka, and Michael Veal). Equal weight in the course will be given to reading, listening, and writing as valuable modes of interacting with music. Throughout the course of the term, students will learn to listen more closely to sound and to develop a critical capacity for relating these sounds to the political and social worlds from which they emerge. Turning our attention back and forth between the local and the transnational, Black Atlantic Music is a window into how music takes shape in the context of culture, politics, geography and history. Evaluations will be based on regular written responses, a final project, and participation in class discussions and activities.

ES,4061,W ES,Topics in Scientific Research: Geoscience and Geochemistry,"Hall, Sarah","This is a course in conducting scientific research and practicing scientific communication through writing and oral presentation. Each student will spend the term working on one research project that is part of broader ongoing research by COA faculty or community-based work in the MDI region. Topics for student projects will be tied to existing projects and in collaboration with researchers, educators, and community members. The projects may follow a wide range of formats and should connect to student interests. Some examples of possible projects include: investigating seasonal variation in surface water and groundwater quality and quantity, identifying the resource needs of high school educators teaching data literacy based on geoscience datasets, interpreting the paleoecology of a location based on a sediment core, exploration of geochemical reactions, analyzing levels of contamination in the environment, or the review and synthesis of the state of EPA standards for the acceptable limits for chemicals found in drinking water. After choosing a project, students will ask questions of existing data, review existing literature, design the next phase of a project, collect observations, and make interpretations based on those observations. Each week, students will practice writing and peer review of project components: proposal preparation, literature review, methodology description, presentation of results or products, data visualization, interpretation and synthesis connected to prior work, and potential future work. Class time will be used for lectures, meetings with visiting collaborators or field trips, student presentations, and writing instruction and revision. Students will be evaluated based on their weekly written work, their ability to meet milestones throughout the project work, and their final dissemination (report and oral presentation) of their project.

HS,2110,W HS,"College Seminar: Barbed Wires, Drawn Lines","Taneja , Palak","How many times have you mused about the idea of borders? What do the lines that divide us mean, and how are we to make sense of them? Literature has always been a place where questions like these have been thought aloud. Whether the borders are geographical or metaphorical, whether they keep people out or fence people in, borders are liminal spaces that raise questions about politics, oppression, belongingness, and identity, which makes them an important subject for our interrogation. Since these literatures are born of political events, our first concern will be to understand the history of the events themselves. We will achieve that by reading excerpts from the works of Gyanendra Pandey, Stanley Waterman, Joe Cleary, and others in juxtaposition with literature. In addition, the literary works by Saadat Hasan Manto, Seamus Deane, Gloria Anzaldúa, and the like will help put the bigger picture in perspective bringing in various thematic concerns like religion, violence, language, and gender together. This class will thus explore two types of borders: one that course texts evoke, helping you critically engage with the theme. The other kind exists between various genres you will encounter like short stories, novels, literary theory, official reports, and movies. The latter, coupled with your writing assignments that we will workshop throughout the term—personal narrative, online article, movie review, multimodal project, and others—will facilitate and deepen your understanding not only of literature from the borders but also writing as a process—prewriting, writing, and rewriting. This course meets the writing requirement.

We seek to understand how multiple histories and different aspects of colonialism inform the content and form of the fiction we read and our lives today. Postcolonialism, with its interdisciplinary approach, offers a lens to look at imperial literature and the new literature produced in the former colonies of Africa, South Asia, the Caribbean, and the like. The course will begin with a brief history and exploration of the word “post-colonial” before moving on to look at some of the significant issues and intersections in the field, such as the questions of language, nation, gender, and otherness, among others. The texts by Chinua Achebe, Salman Rushdie, Jean Rhys, accompanied by theorists like Frederic Jameson, Aijaz Ahmad, and Gayatri Spivak, will create a balance where we will use the theoretical pieces as a lens to read and parse out the major and, in some senses, representative postcolonial texts.

ES,4062,QR,Applied Data Science II,"Shank, Kyle S","Applied Data Science II is a continuation of the themes and topics covered in Applied Data Science I. Whereas Applied Data Science I focused on data-cleaning, organization, and visualization, Applied Data Science II will be focused on building quantitative models from data and using those models for predictive purposes. This would be a great class for those interested in a deeper, more focused exploration of modeling within data science and how those skills can be applied across a wide variety of fields. We’ll focus on three major areas of application: (1) practical, field-invariant skills for building complex models from data; (2) understanding, designing, and building predictive models (as opposed to other types such as inferential); and (3) understanding, designing, and building models that rely on various types of statistical learning (also known as “machine learning”) to produce results. Leaving this class, students will be able to immediately apply these modeling skills to a broad array of interests and topic areas. For example: students should have the skills necessary to build predictive models for population sizes in ecological settings based upon field data, or students should be able to build a machine-learning based classification model for whether or not a given student will attend ACM in a given week. We will also take special note to cover areas of ethical concern that arise when using predictive and machine learning models.  Classes will be taught as a mix of live coding exercises, lectures, and group discussions. Prior familiarity with the R programming language and statistics - such as building linear models and hypothesis testing - are required. Students will need to use either their personal laptop or a COA loaner laptop for class and programming exercises. Evaluation will be through class participation and discussion, several data modeling exercises, and a final project. The data modeling exercises will take the form of written analyses of several well-known data sets as well as investigations of synthetic ones created specifically for the course.

As they grapple with these factors, the dominant modes of theory within the discipline have shifted over time, constantly changing architectural canon, style, form, and tectonics in response. The past decade has seen significant advances in technology and practices of sustainability directly affecting architectural practice. We are now faced with ecological and socioeconomic crises that incremental improvements to the built environments and ecologies cannot address. This course seeks to reestablish a basis of architectural design approach that synthesizes these challenges. Through hands-on studio design problems, case-study presentations of precedent material, readings in art and architectural literature and theory, and site visits to realized architectural projects, this course will provide a general introduction to the practice of architectural design viewed through the lens of historic artistic response to societal, ecological, and cultural needs. Students will develop a base understanding of the discipline, while being introduced to architectural representation techniques and the tools used for architectural design and to assess building performance. In doing so, we will center our work around four key design factors actively changing the built environment and practice: Context, Function, Performance, and Identity. Students will be evaluated based on class participation, timely submission of accomplished projects, and their artist presentation.

HS,3104,HS,Are you down with the cause?: Student Activism in Higher Ed,"Blansett, Rachel","Following the founding of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013, many colleges have seen an increase of student protests to address racial injustice and anti-Blackness at their institutions. Student protests have also extended outside of race to cover topics such as gender exclusion and transphobia, sexual violence and harrassment, student labor and wage exploitation, lack of institutional resources, access, representation and more. Student activism can be seen used as a response to specific institutional acts of discrimination and bias while other movements are being built based around national and global events (i.e. Black Lives Matter, #FreePalestine, DACA, etc.). Though we have seen growth of student unrest on college campuses, student activism is actually not new and holds a long, historical legacy in higher education.  

This course will provide an overview of how activism and higher education function together and how they are dependent on one another to operate. Additionally, we will examine the ways student activism has played an integral role in shaping the foundations and progression of higher education and academia. We will review the historical context and importance of student activism on college campuses and the impact of current events and intersectional dynamics. We will analyze the influence of student activism on student learning and retention, the differences in efficacy between online and offline activism, and will provide practical skill-building and praxis towards creating change in higher education and beyond. 

Students will be evaluated based on attendance, in-class participation and discussion, short topical research assignments, and a final project.

The course will especially focus on the efforts of organizations such as Black Lives Matter to reduce the high level of deaths of black people at the hands of police as well as their advocacy for the “defunding” of police. We will also examine strategies to reduce both implicit bias and explicit bias among police officers, as well as efforts to reduce the distrust of police in communities of color by training police in effective skills for de-escalating tense situations. We will examine recent efforts by the United States Department of Justice to improve policing by the use of restraining orders. As a point of comparison, we will spend some of our time reviewing recent or ongoing work conducted in Europe to develop and implement training programs for police officers with the aim to reduce unnecessary and unlawful violence toward Roma people. In addition to the readings, students can expect presentations from and discussions with guest speakers who have been recently working to address the harms of police violence, both in the US and abroad.

HS,3106,NA,Blue Food Systems,"Smith, Hillary","Just three aquatic species account for most seafood consumed in the US: shrimp, tuna, and salmon. But worldwide consumption is more diverse, including an array of finfish, invertebrates, aquatic plants, algae, and other animals. These ‘blue foods’ are fished, collected, gathered, or grown in the sea or freshwater and play essential roles in supporting human health, nutrition, livelihoods, and culture. Recent studies have shown that the top 7 categories of nutrient-rich animal-source foods are all aquatic in origin. So why do food policy and science still heavily focus on terrestrially produced foods, overlooking blue foods? This course will unpack this conundrum and examine blue food systems from ‘bait to plate’ by analyzing food production, provisioning, and consumption as interlinked activities. Blue food production includes small-scale and industrial harvesting and wild capture and aquaculture systems. Provisioning activities link production and consumption: the offloading of catch, storage and transportation of highly perishable foods, transformations from raw fish to the final product, and the marketing and distribution affected to reach consumers. Finally, consumption includes how we acquire our food, cook and eat it, and dispose of waste, as well as our nutritional and health outcomes. While conventional food policy and science have focused on food production in isolation, a food systems framework sheds light on dynamics that impact the flows and distribution of foods with equity implications: which foods are made by whom, where does food go, and who benefits? This course will introduce students to key changes in the goals and means of food policy, focusing on how the emergent dialogue on food systems in fisheries is reframing how we know and govern aquatic resources. A significant portion of the course will be dedicated to examining blue food case studies, which may include: seaweed farming in Tanzania, fishing cooperatives in Mexico, tuna longliners in the Mid-Atlantic, and Lobster fishing in Maine. Students will work in teams to analyze one of these case studies in-depth, applying a food systems lens to examine each case’s sustainability and equity challenges. Students will be evaluated through their participation in class discussions and in-class activities, weekly writing reflections, and co-leading a class with your case study team. The final project will be a group policy proposal outlining how stakeholders could better govern from a ‘food systems’ perspective in your blue food case study.

Our analytical frameworks will be dramatic theory, performance studies, and native theatre studies. This course will better equip students to understand how manipulating the image of the “Indian” through performance contributes to, resists, and complicates colonial erasure and the settler logic. The geographic scope of the course is focused on Native American communities within the United States, but we will occasionally draw from artists based in other territories. Key questions we will engage with are: by what means have Native American communities been represented and performed in U.S. history? What does it mean to represent ourselves and others? What circumstances do artists, activists, and scholars need to consider when making and analyzing performance in the aftermath of colonialism? What are the ties between artistic self-representation by Native and Indigenous peoples and larger political movements towards self-determination?

MD,3016,NA,"Origins: History, Genetics, and Memory","Hess, Helen","Families are a touchstone of many people’s identity, and stories about where we come from and who came before us are often key ways of orienting ourselves and understanding who we are. Storytelling, documentary and photographic collections, and other methods of preserving memories serve as the very concrete ways that many of us come to learn about our immediate family and our ancestors. New techniques of genetic testing provide a method that can contribute to that understanding and in some cases fill in blanks left about ancestors and provide a new source of stories in addition to those passed along from generation to generation. Recreational DNA testing can also provoke discussion about how to make sense of the genetic stories revealed and how they mesh with or challenge people’s sense of themselves. This class will explore the traditional methods of collecting family histories (oral history, genealogical research) and recreational genetic testing as a point of entry into complex issues around history, memory, ethics, race and the role of new technologies. Students will learn the basic skills of doing genealogical research as well as develop an understanding of the strengths and limitations of human genetic testing, which can reveal our shared history as well as our differences.

HS,2111,NA,Queer Literature,"Lewis, Rhiannon","This course traces the development of “queer literature” from the 16th century to the present. We will read selected texts written in English, including poetry, drama, and novels, that involve sexual and gender identities other than straight and cisgender. Selections from queer theorists, such as Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Eve Sedgwick, and Gloria Anzaldúa, will frame our analysis of works by writers such as Christopher Marlowe, Aphra Behn, Walt Whitman, Leslie Feinberg, Audre Lorde, and Ocean Vuong. We’ll explore what constitutes a genre of literature (specifically, queer literature) by identifying themes, tropes, and other defining characteristics. Questions we’ll address include: what makes a work of literature “queer?” Does the writing of a queer-identifying author automatically become part of this tradition? Can a piece of literature be “queer” independent of the author’s identity? How does queerness intersect with other identities, including race and socioeconomic status? What is the social and political importance of queer literature? Evaluation will be based on class participation and weekly response papers, one long paper, and one short, final paper.

AD,3079,ADS,Jazz Manouche,"Henderson, Jonathan","During the 1930s, the French-Romani guitarist Django Reinhardt launched a new musical style. Combining the traditional music of his Romani heritage with French bal-musettes and the Swing music storming Europe from the other side of the Atlantic, Reinhardt pioneered a sound that came to be known as “Gypsy Jazz,” “Jazz Manouche” or “Hot Club Jazz.” This class will focus on the rich musical repertoire flowing from this history as we work to practice, perform, and learn about its sounds and histories. A practice-based course organized around learning and performing the music, it will treat a series of compositions as entry points for lessons in jazz improvisation, understanding harmonic motion, chord voicing, and rhythmic awareness (swing, waltz, bossa, bolero, etc.). In addition to practice-based work, students will also learn about the histories of Romani (Sinti) migration across Europe and the genealogies of musicians as they relate to the development of Jazz Manouche. Students will read texts concerning Django Reinhardt and other key figures and will write a final paper that reflects research into the people, places, and sounds associated with this music. Assessment will be based on class participation, weekly practice logs, and the final paper/project. The course is designed for students with a working knowledge of an acoustic instrument (guitar, strings, bass, percussion, accordion, mandolin, woodwinds, brass, percussion, etc.). The class will be held largely outdoors, so we cannot accommodate piano or electric instruments. Permission of instructor is required to ensure a workable balance of instruments.

Nobody exemplifies these notions better than Rushdie himself. Therefore, this course will be an exploration of the fantastical world of Salman Rushdie through his seminal novel Midnight’s Children. Deemed as one of the Great Books of the 20th century, which won the Booker prize the year of its publication, 1981, and the Booker of Bookers twice over (in 1993 and 2008), the novel is a prime example of postcolonialism with a magical realist twist.
In this class, we will take a deep dive into Rushdie’s novel by paying close attention to the prose and his style and the history and contexts that he sets up in this novel. Therefore, the reading of the novel will be supplemented with historical background and literary criticism that bring up questions of utopia, nation, politics, identity, and subalternity, to name a few. You will be evaluated on class participation and written assignments like discussion posts, an oral presentation, a paper, and a final project.

AD,1063,NA,The History of Making Prints,"Earley, Annika Louise","In this seminar, we will cover the history of printmaking. Rather than take a chronological approach to print history, the seminar examines four broad themes surrounding historical and contemporary printmaking: prints and politics, printmaking as a process, the appropriated image, and collaboration/participation. These themes encompass a breadth of artists, works and time periods. The ideas presented and discussed in this seminar provide a context and a ground for the student to more clearly define their own creative practice and relationship to the history of printed art forms. Readings, writing assignments, and at-home projects challenge students to critically position themselves, as well as the practice of print in general, within the broader scope of visual culture. It also assists in developing a habit of research, and understand that it can be an essential part of the creative process. Assessment will be based on evidence that the student has completed assignments and readings; and, active and meaningful participation in seminar discussions.

HS,2113,NA,Latin American Literature: Pablo Neruda—Residencia En La Tie,"Mahoney, Daniel","Residencia En La Tierra can be translated in many different ways: A Residency on Earth, Residence on Earth, Living on Earth. However, each distinct translation points us toward a single question: What does it mean to be at home on Earth? This is an introduction, in English translation, to the person considered by many to be the greatest Latin American poet of the 20th century, Pablo Neruda. Neruda’s poetry is marked by a series of aesthetic and political metamorphoses as he continually seeks to address the aforementioned question in his early love poems, political poems, sweeping historical works, odes, and nature poems. Like each of us, Neruda was a witness to history, and special attention will be devoted to that history, particularly in terms of the Spanish Civil War, The Cold War, and the Chilean coup. We will look at a broad selection of Neruda’s poetry, historical texts, as well as texts on literary translation. Students will be expected to complete weekly responses to class readings, group projects, a mid term drafted essay, and a final of the student’s own design.

AD,3080,ADS,Intermediate Projects in Photography,"Winer, Joshua","In this intermediate level course, students will explore at least three distinct working methods for making a small body of work. Through demonstrations and subsequent linked assignments, students will explore the figure and portrait, still life tabletop and one other topic to be decided by the group. After completing the three modules, students will have time to complete a final project in the style and method of their choosing. Critiques, readings, and research will help build a visual and intellectual vocabulary to explain and explore these personal projects. The primary goal of this course is for each student to make a meaningful body of work in their own style that could be ‘ready to hang’ in a gallery. We will be spending considerable time in class editing and printing. Students should expect to spend considerable time outside of class making pictures. Self-motivation, the ability to collaborate on an idea or image, and being on time will all be expected. Some prior experience with Adobe Lightroom Classic or Photoshop is highly recommended. Students will be evaluated on their progress towards their goals, and participation in discussions and critiques; pass/fail grade encouraged.

HS,4100,HS,Carbon,"Stabinsky, Doreen","Carbon is the building block of life. It is also central to one of the most critical challenges of this century: climate change. Combustion of fossilized carbon leads to the increase in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide that threaten life across the planet. Trees and other living organisms that store carbon are celebrated as solutions to the growing crisis, yet rampant destruction of these carbon stores continues unabated. The global management of carbon and its impacts includes projects to decarbonize economies and recarbonize ecologies, as well as fantastical technofixes for carbon removal and blocking the sun. Who will decide how much fossil carbon ultimately gets burned? How much land will be claimed by elites to soak up their continued fossil emissions, and where will it be located? What role do carbon markets and geoengineering play in addressing or perpetuating fossil economies? These are some of the questions we will explore.

In the course we use several different theoretical lenses that look at intersections of institutions, nature, economy, and power (critical geography, political ecology, political economy) to understand more deeply the political, economic, and ecological relationships that emerge around forms of carbon (fossil fuels, trees and landscapes, monoculture plantations) in the context of global efforts to address climate change. Topics to be covered include the carbon cycle; carbon economies of coal, oil, and gas; international climate treaties and global politics of governing carbon; carbon markets; climate models; geoengineering and carbon removal; carbon democracy and fossil capital. The aim of the inquiry, and what students should expect to take away from the course, is experience in engaging with theoretical texts and a broader and deeper understanding of the global political economy and local political ecologies of climate change and carbon. Readings will come from academic as well as non-academic literature from think tanks, non-governmental organizations, and social movements. The course will be conducted in a seminar format, with emphasis on class discussion of readings. Students will be evaluated based on engagement in class discussions, regular writing assignments, leading one or more class discussions, and a final project (podcast, presentation, or final synthetic essay).

Each iteration of the course examines the works of either a single playwright or a single play. The writer and the work are researched through performance practice. The class examines the text(s) dramaturgically while developing strategies for performing the work effectively for contemporary audiences. The vast majority of our class time will be spent learning, staging and presenting key monologues and scenes from the play(s) for critique and continued revision. Students will also gain a clear understanding of the historical and political context in which the work was written and together determine if or how it has maintained contemporary relevance. Besides reading the play(s) themselves and screening examples of the work in production, students will likely read related theory, criticism, interviews, essays and articles by or about the playwright. Evaluation is based on participation in class activities, readings and discussion, successful completion of all performance projects including productive rehearsal time both alone and in groups, a portfolio of written responses and demonstrated engagement with a shared class blog.

How and why does relativity and quantum mechanics compel us to discard commonsense ideas about the nature of the physical world that are part of classical mechanics?  Why is there not agreement on how to interpret quantum mechanics, and why does quantum mechanics even need interpretation? This version of Physics II covers Einstein's theory of special relativity and selected topics in quantum mechanics, and is designed to introduce students to some of the formalism and central results of relativity and quantum mechanics, so that they can formulate scientifically grounded answers to the above questions. Throughout the course we will start with first principles and carefully build toward key results, allowing students to see how relativity and quantum mechanics—two of the pillars of modern physics—were constructed and how they cohere as mathematically consistent and experimentally verified theories. The first half of the course will cover relativity topics including the principle of relativity, spacetime intervals and proper time, coordinate transformations, time dilation and Lorentz contraction, and relativistic energy and momentum. The second half of the course will turn toward the foundations of quantum mechanics, including: spin-1/2 particles, wave-particle duality, and Bell's inequalities and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. If time permits, we may cover additional topics such as blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom, and quantum cryptography. To gain a sense of the scientific, social, and material context in which the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics were developed, we will read a number of papers and book chapters by historians and philosophers of science. This course is designed to appeal to a wide range of students—both those whose interests lie outside of science as well as those who are drawn toward the sciences or mathematics. Students who take this course should be comfortable working with mathematical abstraction. Evaluation is based on weekly problem sets, participation in weekly discussion sections, and several short reflection assignments.

From birth to death people are curious about their bodies and relationships. So why is it that so many people feel they lack the knowledge and skills to be sexually healthy? This class will begin by exploring the tenets of comprehensive sexuality education (CSE), its history, and the religious, cultural and political reasons as to why it is or isn’t taught across the globe. Over the course of the term, students will explore theoretical frameworks and strategies for teaching CSE, design an original lesson plan, practice facilitating, and provide feedback to their peers. Course topics may include strategies for cultivating safe learning environments and tools for promoting classroom discussion. We will discuss the principles of mentorship and how to engage young people in positive conversations about sexual decisions, as well as how to navigate teaching across diverse cultures, personalities and learning preferences.

HS,3109,HS,Food and War Part I,"Collum, Kourtney","Food systems have long been globalized and interconnected. Consequently, conflict in one part of the world often affects food systems in other parts of the world. Indeed, some scholars have argued that war has made our contemporary food systems. In this course, we will draw on the fields of food studies, history, anthropology, international studies, and political science to understand how war has shaped and been shaped by past and contemporary food systems. Designed as a two part course, Food & War Part I focuses on World War I, World War II, and the Cold War between the United States, the Soviet Union, and their respective allies. We will also examine the influence of the Cold War on efforts to bring about a “green revolution” across Asia in the 1950s and 1960s and across Africa today. Throughout the term we will consider how modern war tactics have evolved from historical approaches to conflict, from burning and salting fields to slaughtering livestock and wild game. As a reading and discussion based course, we will primarily examine our topic through books and peer-reviewed articles as we consider the questions: How has food been used as both a weapon of war and a tool of diplomacy? How has conflict transformed the ways people grow, harvest, and eat food? And how have agricultural methods, inputs, technologies, and cuisines spread and evolved in relationship to war? Students will be evaluated based on preparation for and participation in class discussions; a series of synthesis papers; and a final paper.

ES,1086,ES QR,Introduction to Field Sampling: Collection to Data Points,"Hudson, Reuben","In this course, students will learn how to ask relevant field science questions, how to collect samples in the field (soil, water, air, plant, plankton, sediment), and how to process the samples in the lab (sieving, counting, digesting, extracting), how to turn those samples into data points, and how to communicate the findings. When technical field skills are necessary for sample collection, we will offer co-curricular instruction (knot tying, canoeing for lake sediment coring, kayaking for water sampling, etc). This course will cover microplastic analysis in water and soils, water chemistry (ions, pH, organic pollutants), and charcoal analysis in sediments. Students will be evaluated based on participation in field sampling, lab processing, and lecture discussions, as well as through regular problem sets and a term-long writing project. Students will need waterproof shoes, sturdy hiking boots, raingear (rain pants and raincoat) and appropriate layers (synthetic or wool) for spending prolonged periods of time outside. If students do not have their own personal gear we can provide it for them if we are informed by the start of the course. All technical equipment (canoes, lifejackets, coring equipment) will be provided.

This course is not permission of instructor, but it is linked to a pre-matriculation summer STEM program. All seats will be reserved for first year students.

ES,3094,ES,Dynamic Landscapes,"Hall, Sarah","In this course students will learn to make place-based observations of landscapes to consider the processes shaping them. Various climatic and tectonic processes such as erosion and active mountain building are continuously shaping Earth’s diverse landscapes. Humans and other organisms are also shaping and reshaping the Earth’s near surface and have been for at least thousands of years. We can describe these geomorphic processes both qualitatively and quantitatively in order to understand the rates and timescales over which different landscapes develop and evolve. Our descriptions and interpretations of evolving landscapes enable thoughtful interaction and inhabitation. Students will learn about the processes forming and shaping landscapes through both the interpretation of their own local observations as well as an exploration of prior accounts.  We are fortunate to have a rich record of people’s interactions and considerations of the landscape of coastal Maine spanning thousands of years. Students will engage with different accounts of the regional landscape through readings, maps, and conversations with community members. We will also compare aspects of this region’s iconic glacially carved coastal landscape with that of other similarly formed landscapes that are currently located in different geographic, climatic, tectonic, and built environments and therefore exposed to different active processes. Students will learn methods of determining the rates of landscape-shaping processes in order to consider the role of human activities in landscape change. By combining different types of temporal and spatial information, students will learn to identify regional hazards such as mass-wasting events (landslides, debris flows, rock falls, etc.), flooding and coastal erosion. Students will be evaluated based on their performance on weekly assignments and a final project in which students choose one specific coastal Maine location to study. As we will engage with various materials describing landscapes throughout the term (i.e. narrative accounts, maps, scientific reports), this project will be an opportunity for students to practice place-based communication.

HS,1101,NA,"American Exceptionalism: Land of Liberty, Built on Slavery","Blaine, James","One day in the late spring of 1630, somewhere in the North Atlantic, John Winthrop told his Puritan congregation that “we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us.” And so, days before the Arbella anchored in what would become Boston Harbor and 146 years before independence had been declared, American Exceptionalism was born. Or was it? Eleven years earlier, write the authors of The 1619 Project, “a ship appeared [off] the British colony of Virginia. It carried more than 20 enslaved Africans, who were sold to the colonists. America was not yet America, but this was the moment it began [and from it] grew nearly everything that has made America truly exceptional.” This seminar will examine the complex legacy of the idea of American Exceptionalism through four defining primary documents across four centuries: “A Model of Christian Charity” (1630), “Declaration of Independence” (1776), “Gettysburg Address” (1863), and “I Have a Dream” (1963). We will also draw from recent academic and popular works by Edward Baptist, Isabel Wilkerson, Nikole Hannah-Jones, James McBride, and Clint Smith, among others, that will provide both historical and critical context to help situate these texts and make sense of what they mean for us today.  Drawing from additional accounts from various periods in US history, we will wrestle with the contrasting narratives of identity and lived experience  to learn what they can tell us about the past, present, and future of the United States, its people, and its relationship to the rest of the world. This is an introductory discussion based reading seminar. Prior coursework or knowledge of United States history is not necessary for taking the class.

HS,1102,HS HY,"Equal Rights, Equal Voices: Articulating Suffrage","McKown, Jamie","This seminar will provide an in-depth exploration of public speech texts by a wide array of 19th century woman suffrage activists in the United States. This includes works by those individuals most often associated with the first wave of the movement including: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Ernestine Rose, Anna Dickinson, Lucretia Mott,  Victoria Woodhull, as well as other activists who are generally less well known today. While this is a course rooted in the history of what we might consider early American feminism, it should come as no surprise that, along the way, we will confront issues that continue to have salience today.  Many of the topics surrounding gender, sex, identity, equality, empowerment, and political allyship that these activists wrestled with are still just as relevant for us to consider in our contemporary context.  This is especially true when it comes to the topic of race and the intersectional nature of the discourse around gender equality, both then and now. We will spend time examining how the idea of race was rhetorically constituted, in both exclusionary and inclusionary ways, within these texts.  We will also look specifically at the works of early Black feminists in the United States, and the myriad of ways they  navigated the challenges of the moment, especially as they confronted a deeply embedded legacy of white supremacy within the early woman suffrage movement.   Rather than rely primarily on secondary historical accounts, there will be a heavy emphasis on the close reading of primary source materials, mostly speeches, as we encounter these speakers “in their own words.” In addition, students will also take part in “hands on” recovery projects designed to locate, transcribe, document, and make broadly accessible works  from the period that have been previously undocumented or left unaccounted for. In doing so, students will learn basic techniques for exploring and making effective use of various types of digitized historical collections that have emerged in recent years. Class sessions will be organized as a discussed based seminar.  Assignments will emphasize critical, reflective, and analytical writing. Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussion, short written response papers, two longer form take-home essays, individual presentations, and a final “recovery” project.

ES,1087,QR,Introduction to Programming and Computing,"Baker , Laurie","Computer science is about discovering accurate solutions to interesting, challenging problems that have real-world impact, and about representing the solutions in a precise way so that computers can assist with solving the problems. This course explores computational thinking and problem solving via an introduction to computer programming. Students learn the fundamentals of programming using Python, including basic data structures, flow control structures, functions, recursion, elementary object-oriented programming, and discussion of higher-level concepts including abstraction, modularity, testing, and debugging.

Like many fields of study, computing does not occur in a vacuum, but has real social, environmental, and political implications; whether it be the carbon footprint of running Google’s language model, BERT, or how missing data undermines equitable societies. Through reflection and class discussion we will engage in contemporary issues in equity and social justice related to our digital world, community, and identity. This course is intended to appeal to a wide range of students. The computing skills learned in class are language independent, thus this class will be helpful for students interested in computing, regardless of the languages and domains they’ll end up working in. The skills and habits of mind taught in this course are applicable to the sciences, arts, social sciences, and beyond and lay the foundation for future computing courses and varied computational applications such as generative art, software development, bioinformatics, and sensor and app design.

Evaluation will be based on several short homework and lab assignments inspired by real-world problems, weekly reflections, and a final creative project.

ED,2013,NA,Teaching and Learning Music in Human Ecology,"McLean, Adam","Music has been a powerful component of human ecology since time immemorial. It can carry our stories, express our values, communicate aspects of our individual and communal identities, and help us understand those of others. Consequently, the ways that music has been transmitted across generations have had profound impacts on the course of humanity. Understanding how and why music is taught and learned is, therefore, crucial to understanding human ecology. Using transdisciplinary resources from social studies, musicology, education studies, neuroscience, and more, this course will explore how people learn music, what people learn through music, and how musical teaching practices can reflect and shape the cultural identities of individual learners and their communities. In addition to taking part in seminars centered around multimedia course materials, students in this course will observe and engage in music teaching and learning experiences–both formal and informal. Assessment of student work will include participation in class discussions and musical experiences, a report on music education practices in a chosen cultural context, reflective journals on a multi-week music teaching or learning practice, and a demonstration lesson that uses music in some way. All musical interests and levels of musicianship (including novices) are welcome in this course.

HS,3111,NA,Designing Your Life,"Friedlander, Jay","Students hear a series of conflicting messages when it comes to their education and future. Advice, impulses and pressures to “follow your passion”, “study something that will lead to a job”, “create positive change in the world”, can be overwhelming. This is especially true at a school where students design their own major and pathway through the curriculum.

In this course, students will embark upon a journey to design their lives, while simultaneously learning from others who are seeking to balance work, life, family, education, creating change and the myriad of other quotidian tasks. 

Two central questions frame this course: 
How have people seeking to change the world and pursuing their passion sustained themselves personally and professionally? 
How should human ecologists think about and plan their future?

To enrich the process of designing their own lives, students will also learn about the challenges and rewards people encounter when dedicating their lives to creating change. Resources include articles, guest lectures, case studies, interviews and other sources. Highlighting the essential links that exist between professional and personal, ideas and implementation, students will examine a range of careers and endeavors united by their desire to create change. Through this process, students should reflect on what it means to create change in the world and how to embark on that journey.

Students will be evaluated based on their performance, participation and the quality of the assignments they produce over the course of the term including: class participation and facilitation; reflection papers; and a final project.

HS,3112,HS QR,"Language, Power, and Computation: Algorithmic Text Analysis","Feldman, David","Computational text analysis (CTA) is an emerging field that uses computation to analyze texts. CTA draws on the fields of computer science, machine learning, computational linguistics, and literary theory. Using machine learning and statistics, computers can be used to explore how language is used in particular contexts, including how frequently different words are used, the sentiment of a word/text, as well as nuances in the ways words are associated with one another.

We will use CTA to engage in “Distant Reading”, a term coined by literary theorist Franco Moretti. Distant Reading stands in contrast to the more familiar “Close Reading”: a deep engagement with a particular text or a passage from a text. Distant Reading engages not with a particular text, but with a large corpus of texts: e.g., all novels published in English in the 20th century, all articles written in The New York Times and The Washington Post in the last decade, or the lyrics of all top-100 pop songs from the 1980s. Computational techniques applied to large collections of texts allow one to ask broad questions about structural and linguistic change over time and to look for patterns of language use that would not be evident from analysis of one or even several individual texts. Distant Reading, and computational text analysis more generally, is not intended to replace close reading, but to complement it.

We will use CTA to explore how power structures and systems—such as race, gender, and colonialism—manifest themselves in bodies of text. For example, CTA has been used to investigate Islamophobia, analyze race in US novels, explore settler colonialism in the Americas, and to investigate shifts in anti-Asian sentiments in the US brought on by the COVID crisis.

Students will who successfully complete this course will: 1) gain a conceptual understanding of various CTA techniques, including word frequency analysis, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis; 2) learn how to apply these techniques using pre-existing software and doing their own coding; 3) gain experience asking questions about power structures/systems—race, gender, colonialism—and how those structures manifest themselves in corpora of text; 4) learn how these questions of power can be explored using algorithmic methods; and 5) gain experience critiquing algorithmic methods through the lenses of race, gender, and colonialism.

Classes will be a mixture of lecture, group exercises, discussion, and live coding. Readings will include case studies and selections from literary theorists. Evaluation will be based on participation in discussion and in-class activities, several short coding/analysis exercises, several short reflection assignments, and a group project on a topic of the students’ choosing.

HS,2114,HS,Social Media and Its Effects: An Introduction,"Tardif, Twila","Social media is an aspect of modern life that has become ubiquitous. It is difficult to meet someone and part ways without asking for how to keep in touch with them. Instagram, TikTok, SnapChat, Discord? What is it that you spend your time on and why? Have you met all the people you’re connected with? What do you share? What do you view? Why do we connect? A lot comes with these connections. Good things – like the ability to instantly connect not only with your friends, but also thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers worldwide; the ability to see news and search for information in any language anywhere and at any time of day; movies, books, and music; and the ability to share your views and voice with others without having to pay for any of it. And other things too … there are many costs associated with social media use, and many feel that regular breaks or even complete ruptures from social media are necessary, whereas others feel that they could never let it go. In this class we will examine our own use of social media, learn ways to understand how and when it is harmful or helpful to mental health and other aspects of daily life, and how to do research on this important topic. 

Students will gain a general understanding of how to approach psychological questions using the methods of scientific psychology, as well as learn about basic concepts in social, personality, developmental, and cognitive psychology.

Students will be evaluated based on attendance, in-class participation, reading responses, and a final research paper that proposes a research study or is a detailed literature review on social media and its effects.

Addiction comes in many forms – drugs, sex, food, video games, and virtually anything to which we become “addicted.” We will explore the neurobiological mechanisms of addiction and how they relate to human behavior. Basic structures and functions of the brain, neurons, neural networks, and neurotransmitters will be covered in addition to theories of learning and motivation that relate to addiction. Readings will include original research articles, media coverage on addiction, and textbook-style chapters with self-paced quizzes on the basic psychological and neuropsychological concepts covered throughout the term.

AD,4037,ADS,Futurity: A Production Monster Course,"Baker, Jodi","This winter, students will collaboratively research and stage a production of César Alvarez and the Lisps’ Futurity (2015), a work of musical theater about two people dreaming of a technological utopia during one of the darkest periods of American history. The musical looks back to the Civil War to raise contemporary questions about the role of technology in visions for liberation. The “thinking machine” at the center of Futurity asks us to consider the merger of human and machine in today’s technological age. Our staging of the production will benefit from the collaboration of electroacoustic sculptor Mark Dixon, whose novel musical instruments will feature in the role of the “Steam Brain,” the “thinking machine” that Futurity’s protagonists hope will bring an end to human suffering. Evaluation will be based on demonstrated engagement with all course elements and materials, and successful navigation and contributions to the shared production project. Students interested in being a part of the performing ensemble (actors, singers, musicians), and/or those interested in set, lighting and sound design, stage management, dramaturgy, etc. are encouraged to apply. To be considered, students must complete the questionnaire provided via email by the end of week 5, Fall term. This intensive process will result in a run of performances at the end of the Winter term. The course counts for 3 full credits and requires a considerable time commitment.

HS,5063,HS,Conspiracy Theories and Theories of Conspiracy,"McKown, Jamie","The fear of the “hidden” enemy that lurks behind the curtain, controlling events from the shadows, is a narrative topos that continually seems to raise its conspiratorial head in all kinds of spaces and venues: from politics to pop culture, movies, novels, music, political speeches,  etc.   Yet, there is also evidence to suggest that widespread acceptance of these conspiracy “theories” has the potential to cultivate and propagate inherently antidemocratic, divisive, and dangerous beliefs. Those who posit the existence of conspiracies, or at least certain ones, are often dismissed outright as irrational, without any consideration made as to the substance of their claims. Belief in conspiracies, or at least certain ones, is taken as a sign of faulty logic or reason.  Yet, despite this, conspiratorial explanations of various phenomenon actually have a long and vibrant history of popular acceptance in US political culture (as well as in other parts of the world). Some have gone so far as to suggest that narratives of conspiracy, as alternative or resistant explanatory frames, are actually a necessary component of democratic political life. After all we know that conspiracies, political and otherwise, have existed in the past, and may exist again in the future.  How do we make sense of this tension? If conspiracy theory as a mode of explanation is inherently “irrational,” what does this mean for its enduring presence in our political discourse? Is the only difference between a “reasonable” claim rooted in fear and what we consider the paranoid ramblings  of “kooks” and “nutjobs” simply a matter of which one is “correct?” Is there a silver bullet theory or magic wand that would allow us to differentiate the supposed good from the bad? Is the very act of labeling something a conspiracy theory itself a form of political hegemony? Even if conspiracies might exist, is it better to live in a world in which we  assume they don’t? What do we actually mean by conspiracy theory in the first place? This seminar will explore a variety of topics related directly to how threats of conspiracy become manifest in public discourse.  Readings will focus on secondary research that examines the role of conspiracy theories in political and social life, both in the United States and abroad. We will also supplement this with primary “artifacts” such as pamphlets, social media postings, videos, speeches, etc.   Along the way  we will also use this as an opportunity to reflect on what inter and trans disciplinary research actually looks like. The study of conspiracy narratives is an ideal example that helps us think about how different fields attempt to make sense of a phenomenon.   We will survey, compare, and attempt to synthesize research from a wide range of fields, disciplines and methodologies including those from historians, anthropologists, political scientists, legal scholars, literary critics,  psychologists, and others. This is an advanced seminar and students should expect to encounter readings that are rooted in disciplinary perspectives they are not familiar with. Students will need to adapt to shifting  perspectives in order to both the various texts  in conversation with each other.   Evaluation will be based on in-class discussion as well as individual student writing assignments. Students will produce several short length essay assignments during the term as well as a longer research paper at the end of the term. Weekly lab sessions will be used for screenings of primary material  and  students may also be responsible for at least one primary source presentation during these sessions.

This project-based science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics (STEAM) curriculum engages K-12 students to learn how their home, school and community use energy. It culminates with students conducting an energy assessment of their school, identifying ways to reduce energy consumption, costs and carbon emissions. Envirolution is a non-profit organization based in Reno, Nevada, that works with 200+ teachers in Nevada, California and Arizona. Through this course we will be helping to introduce their Project ReCharge lessons and activities to teachers and students in Maine.

Working in pairs or small groups, students will trial the lessons with their COA classmates, taking feedback and refining their approach. They will deconstruct the lesson plans and identify ways that climate change and environmental justice can be further incorporated into the activities. We will discuss systemic injustices rooted in fossil fuel consumption, and the impacts of energy use on the environment and marginalized communities. At the end of the term, each group will partner with a local K-12 school and lead the students through one or more lessons centered on energy efficiency. This course will feature community partnerships and collaborative approaches to addressing fossil fuel consumption and climate change.

HS,3113,NA,Then the Queen Died of Grief: The Craft of Plot,"Cass, Blake","In Aspects of the Novel, E.M. Forster differentiated between “story” and “plot,” defining a story as “a narrative of events arranged in their time sequence” and plot as also a narrative of events but with “the emphasis falling on causality.” The king died and then the queen died. That’s a story. The king died and then the queen died of grief. That’s a plot. Of course, not everyone agrees. Grace Paley claimed, “Plot is nothing; the plot is simply a timeline.” Edna O’Brien offered a blunter assessment: “F**** the plot! That is for precocious school boys.”  Many creative writing classrooms have embraced O’Brien’s denigration of plot. When plot is dealt with, if it is dealt with at all, it is done as a means to an end. And yet it is plot and hang-ups about it that often prevent developing fiction writers from finishing promising stories. Inspiration only carries you so far. As Toni Morrison said, “Art appears natural and elegant only as a result of constant practice and awareness of its formal structures.” And so this is what we will do–spend ten weeks examining the structure of short stories that present a range of strategies for plot. But we won’t stop there. Students will write and workshop three of their own short stories, intentionally experimenting with plotted and “plotless” structures. Students will not be evaluated  on the quality of their short stories, as judging that is often quite arbitrary. We will employ a labor-based grading system that puts emphasis on your engagement with assignments and participation in group writing sessions designed to help students create a sustainable writing practice.

His fiction is grounded in and guided by historical events like the violence of 1984, the Partition, and the Opium Wars. The Hungry Tide (2004) seems like a departure then, dealing with the issue of climate refugees. Or rather, it was a beginning. Since then, Ghosh has been a strong proponent of understanding climate and writing about the disaster that will befall us and future generations if we do nothing about it. 

Given the immediacy of climate change, the tutorial will focus on two of his more recent works, The Great Derangement (2016) and Junglenama (2021). Both texts vary in genre, the former a work of non-fiction and the latter graphic prose, and thus approach climate change in different yet effective ways. We will engage with these genres and the themes they evoke through discussions, response papers, an online article, and a final essay. Since this tutorial is a continuation of a college seminar that meets the writing requirement, a significant chunk of time will be spent on the process of feedback, revision, and reflection.",TRUE,B22Q,2022,Q,NA,NA,"A social anthropologist by training, Amitav Ghosh has been one of the foremost South Asian fiction writers",TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA
HS,3114,HS QR,Economics of Surprise: Complexity in Economic Systems,"Taylor, Davis","Economies don’t behave, and markets are full of surprises: housing prices crash, stock market bubbles pop, once-powerful firms wither while previously unknown start-ups surge, and economic production and unemployment yo-yo in the face of a global pandemic. These and many other surprising phenomena occur because markets and economies are complex adaptive systems: they involve a host of nonlinear relationships that make them unpredictable beyond the short-term. Such systems additionally exhibit long memories (history matters), extract and process information from their environment, and exhibit evolutionary processes. Mainstream Neoclassical Economics is well-suited for short term predictions and suggesting market tendencies, but a different kind of economics is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of markets and economies. This course uses concepts of Complexity, a tapestry of interrelated ideas that includes nonlinear dynamics, emergence, fractals, scaling, cellular automata, networks, evolution, and related concepts, to explore economic phenomena that cannot readily be explained by Neoclassical Economics. We will start with a fairly succinct and less-technical introduction to the elements of Complexity outlined above, in part using Agent Based Modeling (ABM) to illustrate various phenomena; in this process, students will be introduced to NetLogo, a powerful software for ABM. (No prior background in programming is required.) We will then move to exploring Complexity Economics, with an initial emphasis on evolutionary processes within markets and economies. We will conclude with examinations of particular complex economic and social phenomena, such as wealth distribution, climate action, and scaling in firms, urban areas, and sociopolitical units. This course is particularly relevant for students interested in economics, business, climate change policy and action, social-ecological systems, and environmental policy. Evaluation will be based on classroom engagement, four problem sets, and a final poster on a topic of the student’s choosing.

As writing studies scholar Toni-Lee Capossela tells us, a tutor will at various times be “a reader, a respondent, a questioner, a critic, a listener, a friend, a colleague, a collaborator, or a guide.” By presenting a range of writing center theories and research, this course will give students theoretical knowledge and practical tutoring strategies that will enable them to make informed choices when working with developing writers across different disciplines and conventions. Topics include negotiating the priorities of a tutoring session, differentiating between and responding to the needs of global and small-scale revision, motivational scaffolding, and understanding the often recursive nature of the writing process. Additionally, students will be exposed to active learning strategies and concepts such as cognitive load theory, the zone of proximal development, embodied cognition, and the affective domain. In the first part of the term, students will put their practical and theoretical knowledge into use by conducting one-on-one tutoring sessions with their classmates.

AD,2038,ADS,The Theory and Mystery of Color,"McMullen, Ernie","Color touches on nearly every aspect of life on earth. It is used to elicit the widest range of emotions and feelings by quickly influencing cellular activity or raising or lowering blood pressure or triggering wakefulness and sleep. Color plays a vital role in mating and reproduction for most life forms and a central role in symbolizing the aspirations of nation states, corporations, and even the humble neighborhood grade school. In the realm of the visual arts color has reigned supreme since the earliest cave paintings and in the mundane material world, color is used universally to influence the buying decisions of everything from Ferraris to Fruit Loops.  A theory can be defined as a well substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment, and a mystery is defined as something that baffles our understanding and cannot be explained. This course will move between modern scientific color theory and the mysterious world of color mixing, interaction and design. We will study historic and modern pigments and their uses and applications across a broad range of the visual arts and will devote substantial class time to the design and execution of color design problems.  The five goals of this course are: to develop a solid working knowledge of scientific color theory;  to develop significant skills in seeing, mixing and organizing color through studio exercises and assignments;  to produce a body of work that you are proud of; to develop constructive and helpful critiquing skills; to permanently enliven and enrich the way you move through the visual world in a way that invites you to share the mystery of color with others.  Class time will be divided into lecture, critique, studio exercises, and explanation of assignments due for the following class critique.   Students will be evaluated on the quality of the required assignments presented for critiques as well as their class attendance and attentive participation in all aspects of the studio meetings. This class is an excellent option for students who are interested in the visual arts, but also will have value for students with a wide range of interests and backgrounds outside of the arts. Prior experience in drawing, painting, or other visual arts is not a necessary prerequisite for the course.

We use a transdisciplinary approach (in questioning, observing, documenting, interpreting and hypothesising) to develop a reflective practice for considering ecological interactions and biological processes. From visualising relationships and ‘drawing to know’, to multi-sensory pattern recognition, we explore how arts practice can help inform scientific inquiry. 

The first 7 weeks of the course involve readings (from historic, such as Goethe, to contemporary, like Gemma Anderson), lectures, class discussion and practical exercises in a diverse set of creative methods for inquiry. These exercises include time outside each week producing work for a field book (a combined sketchbook, observation notebook and reflective practice journal etc). Later in the course each student then focuses more intensively on 1-2 methods of inquiry in a final study of their own devising. 

Evaluation will be based on successful completion of 3 course components: (1) reflective interaction and discussion of assigned readings; (2) weekly exercises and work in a field notebook; and (3) a final study that develops a particular vein of creative questioning and observation about ecological interaction. These can involve diverse methods (from painting to print, video, animation, and sound recordings, to sculpture, dance and other mixed-media… but the final work will be encapsulated in a format for sharing with an external audience.

What are people’s reactions to changing energy regimes? How have people resisted and protested the effects energy infrastructures have on their lives? This course will examine the social history of energy in the United States and Canada from the early 1900s through the present. Using case studies of energy regimes and energy transitions, it explores the uneven effects of energy technologies on disparate groups of people. Students will study the impact of energy transitions on individuals and communities through the lenses of race, class, gender, and coloniality. The course will focus on case studies including petrochemical landscapes, nuclear imperialism, electrification, and energy consumption. Students will also explore the ways individuals have resisted and protested environmental injustices stemming from energy production. These include grassroots mobilizations for alternative energy technologies, consumer movements, and activism against mountaintop removal and highway construction, to name just a few. This course is not a comprehensive social history of energy but introduces students to the ways social, cultural, political, and environmental contexts shape technological change over time.  Students will engage in several essay assignments that synthesize course readings. We will also work on a class project that begins to map out the social history of energy in Maine. What questions do we have about Maine’s energy landscapes? Who are the main protagonists? What energy transitions have shaped this state? Where would we find the archival evidence to write a social history of energy in Maine?  Students will be evaluated on the basis of participation in class discussion, several writing assignments that focus on synthesizing course materials and course themes, and a research project proposal which will include an annotated bibliography.

AD,4040,ADS,Music Ensemble: African Liberation,"Henderson, Jonathan","As newly independent African nations claimed their freedom from colonial rule, an effort was underway to define the sound of these nations. State-sponsored bands likes Bembeya Jazz and Balla et ses Balladins in Guinea developed a sound that announced Guinea as a modern nation. Their music drew heavily from the sounds of Cuban son, entering the newly independent nation into an African diasporic discourse that signaled alliances with international Marxist movements. In 1977 Fela Kuti released the track “Colonial Mentality,” a song that forcefully argued that even seventeen years into Nigeria’s independence from colonial rule, euro-centric mindsets continued to haunt Nigerian politics. That same year, Kalakuta, Kuti’s autonomous communal compound was burned to the ground after an assault by Nigerian soldiers. In 1987, Hugh Masekela released the track “Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela)” on his album Tomorrow. The song caught fire as an anthem of the anti-apartheid movement that would see the political prisoner Mandela freed in 1990 and inaugurated as President in 1994. This practice-based music course will sharpen students’ music performance skills as they engage in the critical study of popular music from the era of African independence. Students will work to perform a musical repertoire drawn from this time period, including the artists listed above as well as Miriam Makeba, Franco Luambo, E.T. Mensah, The Rail Band, OK Jazz, Manu Dibango, and more. In addition to rehearsing and performing a selection of songs, students will engage with reading, listening, and viewing that informs a historical understanding of how music became a venue for contesting visions for post-colonial Africa. In addition to the practice-based research involved in learning a musical repertoire, students will undertake a research project examining the life of an artist who helped shape the sound of post-colonial Africa (sounds that often resonated out into the diaspora). The course will take place in two lab sessions each week, one of which will be dedicated to rehearsal, and one that will be split between rehearsal and academic study/analysis. There will also be an evening session reserved for film screenings and independent rehearsal time. Participants will be assessed based on attendance and participation in class, individual practice and preparedness, the research project, and map quizzes on the African continent.

Central to the upbringing of more than half of the Indian population through comic books, TV shows, movies, and the like, these texts have set the standard for what an ideal Hindu woman should be, bolstering the patriarchal system in the name of religion and culture. Much like Helen of Troy, “the face that launched a thousand ships,” some of these women have been the cause of wars of “epic proportions.” The myth of their beauty has long been part of these narratives, but do we hear them speak? What do we know about the power they yield? Epics have been unable to provide us with concrete answers.
Therefore, we will turn to female authors like Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, Kavita Kané, Volga, and Vaishnavi Patel, who have created spaces where these voices can be heard and analyzed, where these women can be studied as multifaceted humans. We’ll not only close read their novels but also supplement their work with feminist theory and short videos. Eventually, we’ll trace how these epics stay relevant with regard to the issues that plague modern Indian women.

As such, you cannot be a literature student without encountering Shakespeare; the canon has made sure of that. While those who loved the Empire see Shakespeare as an exemplar of English ideals, anti and post-colonial theorists and artists beg to differ.

Therefore, this course will be an introduction to some such theorists and artists. We will read Shakespeare’s plays like Othello, The Tempest, and others from among the following—Macbeth, Hamlet, King Lear, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Much Ado About Nothing—with an eye toward postcolonial interpretations, thinking about the issues of race, power, hierarchy, and others.

ES,3097,ES QR,Introduction to Epidemiological Modeling,"Feldman, David","Mathematical models are an essential tool in epidemiology. Models are used in a number of ways, including: to predict the course of an epidemic; to estimate key epidemiological parameters; to determine an optimal vaccination strategy; or to gain a general, qualitative understanding of the salient features of the dynamics of a disease. This course will focus on differential equations, a class of mathematical models used across the sciences to model quantities that change continuously in time. The course will begin with a short introduction to differential equations. We will then step through the full “pipeline” of mathematical modeling using epidemiology as a case study. We will begin with a first-principles derivation of several models and will consider how the natural history of an infectious disease influences modeling choices. We will then see how to solve and analyze differential equations computationally. We will then cover how to calibrate a model to epidemiological data and estimate key model parameters in a principled way. Finally, we will see how to create model projections for different intervention scenarios and will explore the strengths and limitations of a mathematical model in relation to given research and policy questions. Through this process, students will gain skills and experiences that will apply to mathematical modeling in a range of settings across the natural and social sciences.

In addition to learning the mathematics of differential equations applied to epidemiology, a central goal of this course is to gain skills necessary for research in the mathematical, natural, and social sciences. This includes conceptualizing and framing a research question, formulating a model to explore that question, engaging with peer-reviewed research publications, and giving a research presentation and preparing a short technical report.

Evaluation will be based on class participation, problem sets and programming exercises, and a term-long project culminating in a research presentation and short technical report.

HS,1105,HS,The Psychology of Nature,"Tardif, Twila","Understanding how we as humans experience life beyond our “built” and “human” environments ought to be a fundamental aspect of our existence but, increasingly, it is not. This class considers the relationship of humans to their natural environments and asks how our natural environments impact us as individual humans, humans in different natural settings, and groups of humans. It will include perspectives from Ecopsychology, Positive Psychology, and ways of understanding nature and our relationship(s) with it from multiple perspectives, including Indigenous perspectives from Turtle Island, the perspective of Settlers and Migrants, as well as both Indigenous and Non-Indigenous perspectives from non-Western societies. We will also explore different research methods to help us understand the effects of nature on well-being.

The course will include an experiential and journaling component in addition to discussions and assigned readings. Classes will include two regular discussion/working meetings as well as one “experiential” session per week including a hike or other ways of spending time in natural and/or cultivated environments on land or water. Classroom sessions will involve discussion with written responses, opportunities to lead discussions, and assignments throughout the semester. We will learn to observe our own responses to experiences and combine these with readings and discussions of both qualitative and quantitative research for understanding our experiences in nature. Students will be evaluated based on attendance, in-class/experiential participation, reading responses, and a final project that demonstrates depth of understanding on a topic of their choice in the Psychology of Nature.  A note about accessibility: This will be an inclusive experience and you are not expected to be able to hike the Appalachian Trail or canoe the Allagash. It will be a “choose your challenge” approach with respect to both difficulty/strenuousness and degree of “nature” that is involved, although you are expected to dress appropriately for being outside during the experiential sessions. Outdoor adventurers of all sorts are welcome from the intrepid to the trepid and everyone in between.

HS,1106,HS,Bilingualism and Bilingual Education,"Tardif, Twila","Learning to speak is one of the most remarkable feats of early childhood. Speaking and becoming literate in multiple languages is even more amazing. This course will examine how children accomplish this task and the steps they go through in becoming (bi)lingual and (bi)literate in two or more languages. We will discuss both “typical” and atypical development in the learning of multiple languages, and media and educational efforts to improve children’s language and literacy development. Importantly, we will also consider how “English only” policies have affected indigenous, immigrant, and minority communities, and how language revitalization practices are attempting to reinstitute bi/multilingual education.
Topics include both “myths” and realities of bi- and multilingualism around the world. It will include how children come to learn the first and second languages, including phonological, lexical, and grammatical development. It will also consider differences in “acquired” bilingualism versus second-language learning through instruction, relations between spoken and written language development, language disorders, efforts to improve language development and second-language learning, and relations between language and thought. It will consider how policies and practices in creating bi- and multilingual citizens vary across the world, and with different languages as L1 and L2, and the implications for language use in these regions. The course is a lecture and discussion format with written responses, opportunities to lead discussions, and assignments throughout the semester. We will also observe how multiple languages are used in daily lives and engage in conversations with researchers and language instructors who visit our class either “virtually” or in person. It should be of interest for students interested in developmental psychology, linguistics, education, and language learning in general.

Students will examine the philosophical approaches that have shaped public library services, and changes that have occurred in response to social and political movements. Different segments of the public will be explored in terms of their need for and use of the public library, including parents, youth, teachers, and elders. Students will read and discuss various claims about the current purpose of public libraries in the digital age, research library services in communities across the US and internationally, and survey their community about desired information and services at their local public library. They will then develop mission statements and service plans for public library services to meet the needs of local communities that they will present in the final class meeting.

AD,2040,NA,The Art of Clown,"Oblongata, Donna","The archetype of the clown exists in many cultural contexts throughout time - those individuals whose role it is to turn society on its head, poke fun at the powerful and make literal fun of our own flaws and vulnerabilities – society’s pressure-release valve. Contrary to common pop-culture depictions, clown is a form that requires tremendous vulnerability, self-knowledge and the ability to respond spontaneously in any performance context. The work in this class will be derived from a sequence of games and exercises geared toward the discovery and development of each student’s own clown self. Training and research will be drawn from theatrical improv traditions, stand-up comedy, circus history and European and Canadian clown pedagogies. Students will perform for each other every week, experimenting with different approaches. Some readings and video will be required. Students will be evaluated on effective preparation and engagement with all materials and course topics as well as completion of all class assignments.

ES,3099,ES,Introduction to Tropical Field Ecology,"Ressel, Stephen","This intensive, field-based course examines fundamental concepts and processes of tropical ecology through exploration and investigation of a diverse array of bioclimatic zones found within the Central American country of Costa Rica. Students will spend extensive time in the field learning the biotic diversity of each region through observation and application of field techniques. Students will then integrate these field experiences with readings from the primary literature and classic works to contemplate and discuss current topics in tropical ecology. Primary emphasis in this course will be placed on the vertebrate fauna of Costa Rica, with arthropod diversity and ecology addressed in the Tropical Entomology course. The course will visit Caribbean slope rainforest, pre-montane forest, montane cloud forest, Pacific slope dry forest, Pacific wet forest, and Pacific beach/marine communities. Non-travel days will typically consist of early morning to early/mid-afternoon field time, afternoon lectures, or discussions followed by early evening to late night field time. Evaluation will be based on quality of work associated with a series of field-based independent research projects, level of engagement in class discussions, and overall commitment to all aspects of this immersion experience. Permission of Instructor required. Previous coursework in the areas of ecology, organismal biology, or natural history will be taken into account during the selection process.

ES,3100,ES,Tropical Entomology,"Graham, Carrie","Insects are the dominant animals in nearly all terrestrial ecosystems. However, in places like Maine, their abundance, diversity, and impact are not always apparent to the casual observer. This is not so in the tropics! Nowhere else are insects as large, showy, and numerous. Costa Rica is home to at least 300,000 species of insects, approximately one third of all described insect species. We will travel to and observe insects in a Caribbean slope rainforest, pre-montane forest, montane cloud forest, Pacific slope dry forest, Pacific wet forest, and Pacific beach/marine communities. Non-travel days will typically consist of early to late-morning field time, afternoon lectures or discussions followed by early evening to late night field time.

Students will spend extensive time in the field learning and practicing insect identification to the order and family level, observing insect behavior, and studying interspecies interactions. Reading and discussion topics will include insect conservation and declines, relationships between insects and plants, humans, and other animals, and control of agricultural and medical insect pest species. Particular attention will be paid to leafcutter ants, army ants, and other ecologically and culturally significant species. The course schedule will complement the content taught in Introduction to Tropical Field Ecology and will be reinforced through assignments in the Field Journal course. Introductory Entomology is helpful but not a prerequisite.

MD,1032,NA,The Art and Practice of the Natural History Field Journal,"Ressel, Stephen","When you keep a natural history field journal, you join a long and proud tradition, shared through time with naturalists, explorers, and artists. Careful observation of nature, followed by careful writing and illustration, is a time-tested technique for “capturing” some of the wonders of the planet’s life. While many of us have become dependent on technology to record notes and photographs, the practice of keeping a physical journal confers many advantages. Making a sketch requires you to look closely at your subject in a way that taking a photograph does not. A carefully created field notebook is a permanent record that will outlive technical obsolescence and even the life of its creator. Today, the field notebooks of figures such as Henry Walter Bates, Alexander von Humboldt, and Maria Sibylla Merian continue to provide useful data and artistic inspiration centuries after the death of their creators. Students will develop a regular natural history field journal practice by creating a journal as a record of their journey through Costa Rica. Along the way, they will document their observations through structured and unstructured entries using a variety of writing and drawing techniques. Assignments will be based on content from Introduction to Tropical Field Ecology and Tropical Entomology. The journals will be exhibited in an end of term show at the Dorr Museum. Evaluation will be based on completion of assigned entries, individual growth, and overall commitment to all aspects of this immersion experience.

HS,1108,W HS,College Seminar: Current Topics in Media Studies,"Capers, Colin","From McLuhan on, the term media (frequently a plural word employed as singular) has been notoriously difficult to define. Starting in the mid-1980s, scholars, theorists, and practitioners added the modifier new to the mix. What are/is new media and when does it become old? In this course we’ll study foundational texts in this recent field –– Manovich, Rice, Doane, Kittler –– along with historical influences and parallel thinkers –– Lovelace, Haraway, Brand –– and artists such as Mendi & Keith Obadike, Jennifer Chan, Electronic Disturbance Theater –– to determine for our-selves what new media have most to offer a human ecologist. Many observers have pointed to the fact that cinematic technologies and humans’ adaptation to them anticipated many traits and use patterns of digital media. We will look at the ephemerality of newness as we explore what lessons studying old (previously new) media can afford us. Media culture affects our interpretation of the events that occur to and around us, how we teach and learn, our choices regarding how we spend our time and money; and increasingly influences not only how we construct our identities externally, but how we initially establish a sense of self, a set of values, and a conception of how to engage in community. Current issues studied in the class will depend on the interests of the group but may include debates in any of the following areas: genre, archival practices, simulation/reproducibility/modes of consumption, social media & democracy, technology/inclusion/representation, production/access/ownership/copyright/remix culture, media convergence. This course is a college seminar which meets the first-year writing requirement. We will focus on writing as process—prewriting, writing, and rewriting. Students will write and revise three short essays over the course of the term, meeting weekly with the professor or TA and participating in peer-review as part of the writing lab component of the class. Each student will also develop a research paper on a topic of their own choosing determined in consultation with course faculty and TA. Evaluation will be based on class participation; commitment to and effective use of the writing process; and the proposal for, presentation of, and research into their final project.
